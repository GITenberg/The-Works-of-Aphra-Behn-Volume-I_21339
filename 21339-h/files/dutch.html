<h4><a name = "dutch_arg">ARGUMENT.</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">Roderigo</span>&mdash;the natural son of
the great Count d’ Olivarez, minister to Philip IV of Spain&mdash;was,
upon his father’s disgrace, given over when very young to the care of a
certain Don Ambrosio, and by him brought up as his own child. Ambrosio
has one son, Marcel, and two daughters, Hippolita and Cleonte. Marcel,
whilst in Flanders, promised Hippolita to his friend Alonzo. This Alonzo
is the son of a lady Octavia and Don Manuel. But Manuel’s rival in
Octavia’s love, Alonzo, stole their boy when an infant and brought him
up to arms, giving him his own name. Pedro, an old servant, who is
cognizant of this, is sworn to secrecy. Alonzo arrives in Madrid
purposing to wed Hippolita as he desires to ally himself with so ancient
and powerful a family as Ambrosio’s. Hippolita, however, having been
betrayed by a German named Antonio, has fled, and now resides in a house
of pleasure in the town, having assumed the habit of a Venetian
courtezan. Alonzo meeting Euphemia, sister to his friend Lovis, becomes
enamoured of her, and the lady grants him a rendezvous at a house where
they will be uninterrupted&mdash;it happens this house is the bagnio
where Hippolita is secreted. Marcel, on his way to visit Clarinda, whom
he loves, recognizes Alonzo and follows him to his rendezvous, Olinda,
Euphemia’s maid, mistakenly introduces Marcel to her mistress. Euphemia
is veiled and Marcel, who has heard that his sister is living in that
house, in his turn mistakes the lady for Hippolita, more especially as
he meets Antonio there. The two men fight, but Alonzo entering
interferes. Antonio escapes, bearing away Hippolita. Euphemia, whom
Marcel in a passion of revenge would kill, is soon discovered not to be
Hippolita, and the angry brother duly retires from the scene. Alonzo,
however, leaving the house is accosted for Marcel by Dormida, Clarinda’s
maid, who gives him the key to their house. Alonzo enters followed by
Marcel who is close on his heels. They jostle and fight in the darkness
of the hall within, and Alonzo departs leaving Marcel wounded. Dormida
fearing trouble drags Clarinda forth and meeting Alonzo in the street
they throw themselves on his honourable protection. A&nbsp;complete
stranger, in his dilemma he escorts them to the mansion of Ambrosio, and
they chance on Cleonte’s chamber. She has just had a visit from Silvio
(under which name Roderigo passes), who is burning with passion for her
but shrinks from his supposed sister. Cleonte offers the two ladies a
refuge and Alonzo retires. With the aid of his friend Lovis he assumes
the habit of Haunce van Ezel, a&nbsp;Dutch boor who is contracted to
Euphemia, and, as Haunce, courts Lovis’ sister with the full approbation
of their father Don Carlo. When Haunce himself appears he is greeted
with some familiarity as having been at the house before. The Dutch
Lover, who has newly arrived, chances on a strife between Antonio and
Hippolita and interfering disarms Antonio, wounding him in the face.
Cleonte meantime has introduced her guest Clarinda to Silvio, and Marcel
seeing them together concludes that his own brother is the man who
fought him on the previous night and indeed his favoured rival. At once
he challenges him and they arrange to have a duel in a grove near the
town. Here, however, comes Hippolita disguised in man’s attire,
<span class = "pagenum">218</span>
awaiting Antonio to whom she has sent a billet signed ‘Alonzo’. She
retires, whilst Silvio appears, and when he is engaged with Marcel,
Alonzo rushes in and parts them. Alonzo avows that it was he who caused
the confusion with Clarinda, and arranges to meet Marcel later in
another spot. Antonio next arrives and Hippolita, calling herself
Alonzo, draws, but Alonzo himself insists on taking up the quarrel. At
the clash of steel Marcel returns and all four fight, Marcel with
Hippolita, whom he wounds, Alonzo with Antonio, whom he
disarms&mdash;Hippolita reveals herself, Alonzo claims her, but Antonio
declaring that he is bound to her by sacred vows rescues her from
Marcel’s vengeance and obtains his forgiveness. All return to Ambrosio’s
house where they find Cleonte and Clarinda. Explanations ensue, and
Marcel is at Clarinda’s feet. Pedro, however, who attends Alonzo,
recognizes his old fellow-servant, Dormida, duenna to Clarinda, and
learning Don Manuel is dead, reveals that Alonzo is Clarinda’s brother,
also handing over papers left by Don Alonzo the foster-father, which
bestow 12,000 crowns a year on his adopted son, Alonzo portions Clarinda
and gives her to Marcel. Francisca, woman to Cleonte, informs Silvio
that Cleonte will yield to him&mdash;Silvio, suddenly revolted, declares
he will present himself, but secretly resolves to <ins class =
"correction" title = "spelling unchanged">poinard</ins> his sister.
Marcel who has overheard the conference, beside himself with rage,
dashes on Silvio with dagger drawn and when checked by Ambrosio and the
rest who rush in at Francisca’s cries makes known the cause of his
wrath. Francisca confesses that Cleonte had sent no such message, but
herself purposed to take her mistress’ place that night and receive
Silvio. Ambrosio then reveals the secret of Silvio’s birth and gives
Cleonte to him, in his joy even taking Hippolita to his arms since
Antonio has married her. Alonzo, meanwhile, disguised as Haunce has been
united to Euphemia. He is discovered by the arrival on the scene of the
real Haunce accompanied by Gload, a&nbsp;foolish tutor. Carlo is soon
reconciled to the new bridegroom, whilst Haunce and Gload joining in a
masquerade find themselves unexpectedly wedded to Olinda and Dorice, two
women attendant on the lady Euphemia.</p>




<h4><a name = "dutch_source">SOURCE.</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">Mrs. Behn</span>
founded the plot of <i>The Dutch Lover</i> upon the stories of Eufemie
and Theodore, Don Jame and Frederic, in a pseudo-Spanish novel entitled
‘<i>The History of Don Fenise</i>, a&nbsp;new Romance written in Spanish
by Francisco de Las Coveras, And now Englished by a Person of Honour,
London, Printed for Humphrey Moseley,’ 8vo, 1651. There is of course no
such Spanish author as ‘the ingenious Don Francisco de las Coveras’. The
chief merit of the book is purely bibliographical: it is a very rare
volume and difficult to meet with. The Bodleian indeed contains a copy,
but it is not to be found in the British Museum library. The somewhat
morbid theme of overwhelming passion barred by consanguinity eventually
discovered to be false, which is here exemplified in the love of Silvio
for Cleonte, occurs more than once in the later Jacobean and <ins class
= "correction" title = "text unchanged">Carolan</ins> drama. In Beaumont
and Fletcher’s tragicomedy <i>A King and no King</i> (1611: 4to, 1619),
we have Arbaces enamoured of Panthea, his reputed sister; similar
motives are to be found in Arthur Wilson’s <i>The Swizzer</i> (1631);
but in
<span class = "pagenum">219</span>
Middleton’s <i>Women beware Women</i> (circa 1612: 4to, 1657), no
contrivance can legitimize the incestuous loves of Hippolito and
Isabella, and death is the only solution. In Massinger’s <i>The
Unnatural Combat</i> (1621: 4to, 1639), the demoniac Malefort pursues
his daughter Theocrine with the same baleful fires as Francesco Cenci
looked on Beatrice, but the height of horror, harrowing the soul with
pity and anguish, culminates in Ford’s terrible scenes <i>Tis Pity She’s
a Whore</i> (4to, 1633), so tenderly tragic, so exquisitely beautiful
for all their moral perversity, that they remain unequalled outside
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>In the Restoration Theatre the theme of consanguinity was originally
dealt with no less than three times by Dryden: comically, in <i>The
Spanish Friar</i> (1681), when Lorenzo&mdash;after all the
love-brokerage of pursy Father Dominic&mdash;discovers Elvira to be his
sister: tragically, in <i>Don Sebastian</i> (1690), when Sebastian and
Almeyda are separated by the disclosures of old Alvarez: sentimentally
and romantically, in <i>Love Triumphant</i> (1693-4), when Alphonso wins
Victoria whom he has long loved, even whilst she was supposed to be his
sister. Otway it will be remembered turns the pathetic catastrophe of
<i>The Orphan</i> (1680), upon a deceit which produces similar though
unhappy circumstances. In 1679, <i>Oedipus</i>, a&nbsp;joint production
of Dryden and Lee, was brought out with great success at the Duke’s
Theatre, Dorset Gardens.</p>

<p>Unhallowed and incestuous passions again form the plot of <i>The
Fatal Discovery; or, Love in Ruins</i> (4to, 1698), produced at Drury
Lane, a&nbsp;play seemingly derived from <i>Bandello, Part II</i>, Novel
35, which coincides with the thirtieth tale of the <i>Heptameron</i>. In
various forms, however, this legend is to be found in the literature of
all countries, and a cognate tradition is even attached to certain
districts. <i>Innocence Distress’d; or, The Royal Penitents</i>,
a&nbsp;tragedy by Robert Gould (ob. 1709), never performed but published
by subscription (8vo, 1737), for the benefit of his daughter Hannah, is
based on the same story. Gould’s work is weak and insipid.</p>

<p>Later in the eighteenth century we have Horace Walpole’s <i>The
Mysterious Mother</i> (8vo, 1768), an unacted drama of extraordinary
power and undissipated gloom on the same terrible theme; whilst
Shelley’s <i>The Centi</i>, published in 1819, which the poet most
emphatically intended for the boards, remains a masterpiece of supreme
genius.</p>

<p>Wagner in <i>Die Walküre</i> shows the irresistible passion of
Siegmund and Sieglinde, brother and sister, from whose union sprang the
mighty hero Siegfried; and in <i>Gengangere</i> (Ghosts), 1881, Ibsen
threw, by the sickly craving of the fibreless Oswald Alving for Regina,
a&nbsp;lurid light across that awesome tragedy of shadows, Nemesis, and
blank despair.</p>




<h4><a name = "dutch_hist">THEATRICAL HISTORY.</a></h4>


<p><i>The Dutch Lover</i> was produced at the Duke’s Theatre, Dorset
Garden, in February, 1673, but owing to the manifold disadvantages under
which it was put on the stage it did not meet with that success it
certainly deserved. It was indeed, to quote the preface, ‘hugely injured
in the acting.’ The performers were anything but word perfect and
hopelessly forgot or confused their business, which, more especially in
a play of such a type as this romantic comedy so full of busy and
complicated detail demanding close and continuous attention, was enough
to mystify the
<span class = "pagenum">220</span>
audience completely and foredoom the piece to failure. The worst sinner
was Haunce himself, who hardly spoke one of his lines but gagged from
start to finish. Not unnaturally, Mrs. Behn resented this and avows that
she would have trounced him roundly in print except ‘de mortuis...’
Although the original cast is not given, this detail enables us to fix
the representative of Haunce as Angel, a&nbsp;leading comedian, who died
in the spring of 1673, his name last appearing as de Boastado in
Ravenscroft’s <i>Careless Lovers</i>.</p>

<p>In addition to these serious detriments the costumes were very poor,
especially the disguise of Alonzo as the Hollander, and Haunce’s own
‘fantastical travelling habit,’ dresses on the aptness of which the
probability of the intrigue can be made so largely to depend.</p>

<p>Yet another mishap occurred. The epilogue, which had been promised by
a friend, did not come to hand, and accordingly the present epilogue was
hastily composed. Though containing nothing notably witty or pointed it
does not fall below the generality of these productions. Of the prologue
we have no means of judging as it was unfortunately lost before it could
find its way into print.</p>

<p>Had <i>The Dutch Lover</i> received fair treatment from the actors it
should surely have commanded no small success in its day. Technically it
is well contrived, and exhibits the skill and clever stage-craft of its
authoress in a high degree, qualities which have often given a long
lease of life to plays of infinitely less merit.</p>

<p>Good, Sweet, Honey, Sugar-Candied <span class =
"smallcaps">Reader</span>,</p>

<p>Which I think is more than anyone has called you yet, I must have a
word or two with you before you do advance into the Treatise; but ’tis
not to beg your pardon for diverting you from your affairs, by such an
idle Pamphlet as this is, for I presume you have not much to do and
therefore are to be obliged to me for keeping you from worse employment,
and if you have a better you may get you gone about your business: but
if you will misspend your Time, pray lay the fault upon yourself; for I
have dealt pretty fairly in the matter, told you in the Title Page what
you are to expect within. Indeed, had I hung a sign of the Immortality
of the Soul, of the Mystery of Godliness, or of Ecclesiastical Policie,
and then had treated you with Indiscerpibility and Essential Spissitude
(words, which though I am no competent Judge of, for want of Languages,
yet I fancy strongly ought to mean just nothing) with a company of
Apocryphal midnight Tales cull’d out of the choicest Insignificant
Authors; If I had only proved in Folio that Apollonius was a naughty
knave, or had presented you with two or three of the worst principles
transcrib’d out of the peremptory and ill-natur’d (though prettily
ingenious) <a class = "comm" name = "dutch_commtag2" id =
"dutch_commtag2" href = "#dutch_commnote2">Doctor of Malmsbury</a>
undigested and ill-manag’d by a silly, saucy, ignorant, impertinent, ill
educated Chaplain I were then indeed sufficiently in fault; but having
inscrib’d Comedy on the beginning of my Book, you may guess pretty near
what penny-worths you are like to have, and ware your money and your
time accordingly. I&nbsp;would not yet be understood to lessen the
dignity of Playes, for surely they deserve a place among the middle if
not the better sort of Books; for I have heard the most of that which
bears the name of Learning, and which has abused such quantities of Ink
and Paper, and continually employs so many ignorant, unhappy souls for
ten, twelve, twenty years in the University (who yet poor wretches think
they are doing something all the while) as Logick etc. and several other
things (that shall be nameless lest I misspell them) are much more
absolutely nothing than the errantest Play that e’er was writ. Take
notice, Reader, I&nbsp;do not assert this purely upon my own knowledge,
but I think I have known it very fully prov’d, both sides being fairly
heard, and even some ingenious opposers of it most abominably baffl’d in
the Argument: Some of which I have got so perfectly by rote, that if
this were a proper place for it, I&nbsp;am apt to think myself could
almost make it clear; and as I would not undervalue Poetry, so neither
am I altogether of their judgement who believe no wisdom in the world
beyond it. I&nbsp;have often heard indeed
<span class = "pagenum">222</span>
(and read) how much the World was anciently oblig’d to it for most of
that which they call’d Science, which my want of letters makes me less
assured of than others happily may be: but I have heard some wise men
say that no considerable part of useful knowledge was this way
communicated, and on the other way, that it hath serv’d to propogate so
many idle superstitions, as all the benefits it hath or can be guilty
of, can never make sufficient amends for; which unaided by the unlucky
charms of Poetry, could never have possest a thinking Creature such as
man. However true this is, I&nbsp;am myself well able to affirm that
none of all our English Poets, and least the Dramatique (so&nbsp;I think
you call them) can be justly charg’d with too great reformation of men’s
minds or manners, and for that I may appeal to general experiment, if
those who are the most assiduous Disciples of the Stage, do not make the
fondest and the lewdest Crew about this Town; for if you should
unhappily converse them through the year, you will not find one Dram of
sense amongst a Club of them, unless you will allow for such a little
Link-Boy’s Ribaldry thick larded with unseasonable oaths &amp; impudent
defiance of God, and all things serious; and that at such a senseless
damn’d unthinking rate, as, if ’twere well distributed, would spoil near
half the Apothecaries trade, and save the sober people of the Town the
charge of Vomits; And it was smartly said (how prudently I cannot tell)
by a late learned Doctor, who, though himself no great asserter of a
Deity, (as&nbsp;you’ll believe by that which follows) yet was observed
to be continually persuading of this sort of men (if&nbsp;I for once may
call them&nbsp;so) of the necessity and truth of our Religion; and being
ask’d how he came to bestir himself so much this way, made answer that
it was because their ignorance and indiscreet debauch made them a
scandal to the profession of Atheism. And for their wisdom and design I
never knew it reach beyond the invention of some notable expedient, for
the speedier ridding them of their Estate, (a&nbsp;devilish clog to Wit
and Parts), than other grouling Mortals know, or battering half-a-dozen
fair new Windows in a Morning after their debauch, whilst the dull <a
class = "comm" name = "dutch_commtag3" id = "dutch_commtag3" href =
"#dutch_commnote3">unjantee</a> Rascal they belong to is fast asleep.
But I’ll proceed no farther in their character, because that miracle of
Wit (in&nbsp;spite of Academick frippery) <a class = "comm" name =
"dutch_commtag4" id = "dutch_commtag4" href = "#dutch_commnote4">the
mighty Echard</a> hath already done it to my satisfaction; and whoever
undertakes a Supplement to anything he hath discourst, had better for
their reputation be doing nothing.</p>

<p>Besides this Theam is worn too thread-bare by the whiffling would-be
Wits of the Town, and of both the stone-blind-eyes of the Kingdom. And
therefore to return to that which I before was speaking of, I&nbsp;will
have leave to say that in my judgement the increasing number of our
latter Plays have not done much more towards the amending of men’s
Morals, or their Wit, than hath the frequent Preaching, which this last
age hath been pester’d with, (indeed without all Controversie they have
done less harm) nor can I
<span class = "pagenum">223</span>
once imagine what temptation anyone can have to expect it from them; for
sure I am no Play was ever writ with that design. If you consider
Tragedy, you’ll find their best of Characters unlikely patterns for a
wise man to pursue: For he that is the Knight of the Play, no sublunary
feats must serve his Dulcinea; for if he can’t bestrid the Moon, he’ll
ne’er make good his business to the end, and if he chance to be
offended, he must without considering right or wrong confound all things
he meets, and put you half-a-score likely tall fellows into each pocket;
and truly if he come not something near this Pitch I think the Tragedy’s
not worth a farthing; for Playes were certainly intended for the
exercising of men’s passions not their understandings, and he is
infinitely far from wise that will bestow one moment’s meditation on
such things: And as for Comedie, the finest folks you meet with there
are still unfitter for your imitation, for though within a leaf or two
of the Prologue, you are told that they are people of Wit, good Humour,
good Manners, and all that: yet if the Authors did not kindly add their
proper names, you’d never know them by their Characters; for
whatsoe’er’s the matter, it hath happen’d so spightfully in several
Playes, which have been prettie well received of late, that even those
persons that were meant to be the ingenious Censors of the Play, have
either prov’d the most debauch’d, or most unwittie people in the
Company: nor is this error very lamentable, since as I take it Comedie
was never meant, either for a converting or a conforming Ordinance: In
short, I&nbsp;think a Play the best divertisement that wise men have:
but I do also think them nothing so who do discourse as formallie about
the rules of it, as if ’twere the grand affair of humane life. This
being my opinion of Plays, I&nbsp;studied only to make this as
entertaining as I could, which whether I have been successful in, my
gentle Reader, you may for your shilling judge. To tell you my thoughts
of it, were to little purpose, for were they very ill, you may be sure I
would not have expos’d it; nor did I so till I had first consulted most
of those who have a reputation for judgement of this kind; who were at
least so civil (if&nbsp;not kind) to it as did encourage me to venture
it upon the Stage, and in the Press: Nor did I take their single word
for it, but us’d their reasons as a confirmation of my own.</p>

<p>Indeed that day ’twas Acted first, there comes me into the Pit,
a&nbsp;long, lither, phlegmatick, white, ill-favour’d, wretched Fop, an
Officer in Masquerade newly transported with a Scarf &amp; Feather out
of France, a&nbsp;sorry Animal that has nought else to shield it from
the uttermost contempt of all mankind, but that respect which we afford
to Rats and Toads, which though we do not well allow to live, yet when
considered as a part of God’s Creation, we make honourable mention of
them. A&nbsp;thing, Reader&mdash;but no more of such a Smelt: This
thing, I&nbsp;tell ye, opening that which serves it for a mouth, out
issued such a noise as this to those that sate about it, that
<span class = "pagenum">224</span>
they were to expect a woful Play, God damn him, for it was a woman’s.
Now how this came about I am not sure, but I suppose he brought it
piping hot from some who had with him the reputation of a villanous Wit:
for Creatures of his size of sense talk without all imagination, such
scraps as they pick up from other folks. I&nbsp;would not for a world be
taken arguing with such a propertie as this; but if I thought there were
a man of any tolerable parts, who could upon mature deliberation
distinguish well his right hand from his left, and justly state the
difference between the number of sixteen and two, yet had this prejudice
upon him; I&nbsp;would take a little pains to make him know how much he
errs. For waving the examination why women having equal education with
men, were not as capable of knowledge, of whatsoever sort as well as
they: I’ll only say as I have touch’d before, that Plays have no great
room for that which is men’s great advantage over women, that is
Learning; We all well know that the immortal Shakespeare’s Plays (who
was not guilty of much more of this than often falls to women’s share)
have better pleas’d the World than Johnson’s works, though by the way
’tis said that Benjamin was no such Rabbi neither, for I am inform’d
that his Learning was but Grammar high; (sufficient indeed to rob poor
Salust of his best orations) and it hath been observ’d that they are apt
to admire him most confoundedly, who have just such a scantling of it as
he had; and I have seen a man the most severe of Johnson’s Sect, sit
with his Hat remov’d less than a hair’s breadth from one sullen posture
for almost three hours at <i>The Alchymist</i>; who at that excellent
Play of <i>Harry the Fourth</i> (which yet I hope is far enough from
Farce) hath very hardly kept his Doublet whole; but affectation hath
always had a greater share both in the action and discourse of men than
truth and judgement have; and for our Modern ones, except our most
unimitable Laureat, I&nbsp;dare to say I know of none that write at such
a formidable rate, but that a woman may well hope to reach their
greatest heights. Then for their musty rules of Unity, and God knows
what besides, if they meant anything, they are enough intelligible and
as practible by a woman; but really methinks they that disturb their
heads with any other rule of Playes besides the making them pleasant,
and avoiding of scurrility, might much better be employed in studying
how to improve men’s too imperfect knowledge of that ancient <a class =

"#dutch_commnote5">English Game which hight long Laurence</a>: And if
Comedy should be the picture of ridiculous mankind I wonder anyone
should think it such a sturdy task, whilst we are furnish’d with such
precious Originals as him I lately told you of; if at least that
Character do not dwindle into Farce, and so become too mean an
entertainment for those persons who are us’d to think. Reader,
I&nbsp;have a complaint or two to make to you and I have done; Know then
that this Play was hugely injur’d in the Acting, for ’twas done so
imperfectly as never any was
<span class = "pagenum">225</span>
before, which did more harm to this than it could have done to any of
another sort; the Plot being busie (though I think not intricate) and so
requiring a continual attention, which being interrupted by the
intolerable negligence of some that acted in it, must needs much spoil
the beauty on’t. My Dutch Lover spoke but little of what I intended for
him, but supplied it with a great deal of idle stuff, which I was wholly
unacquainted with until I had heard it first from him; so that
Jack-pudding ever us’d to do: which though I knew before, I&nbsp;gave
him yet the Part, because I knew him so acceptable to most o’th’ lighter
Periwigs about the Town, and he indeed did vex me so, I&nbsp;could
almost be angry: Yet, but Reader, you remember, I&nbsp;suppose,
a&nbsp;fusty piece of Latine that has past from hand to hand this
thousand years they say (and how much longer I can’t tell) in favour of
the dead. I&nbsp;intended him a habit much more notably ridiculous,
which if ever it be important was so here, for many of the Scenes in the
three last Acts depended upon the mistakes of the Colonel for Haunce,
which the ill-favour’d likeness of their Habits is suppos’d to cause.
Lastly my Epilogue was promis’d me by a Person who had surely made it
good, if any, but he failing of his word, deput’d one, who has made it
as you see, and to make out your penyworth you have it here. The
Prologue is by misfortune lost. Now, Reader, I&nbsp;have eas’d my mind
of all I had to say, and so sans farther complyment, Adieu.</p>

Enter <em>Alonzo</em> and <em>Lovis</em> in travelling Habits, attended
by <em>Pedro</em> and <em>Gload</em>.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lo.</span>
Dear <i>Alonzo!</i> I shall love a Church the better this Month for
giving me a sight of thee, whom I so little expected in this part of the
World, and less in so sanctifi’d a Place. What Affair could be powerful
enough to draw thee from the kind obliging Ladies of <i>Brabant?</i></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Alon.</span>
First the sudden Orders of my Prince <i>Don John</i>, and next a fair
Lady.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lo.</span>
A Lady! Can any of this Country relish with a Man that has been us’d to
the Freedom of those of <i>Bruxels</i>, from whence I suppose you are
now arriv’d?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Alon.</span>
This morning I landed, from such a Storm, as set us all to making Vows
of Conversion, (upon good Conditions) and that indeed brought me to
Church.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lo.</span>
In that very Storm I landed too, but with less Sense of Danger than you,
being diverted with a pleasant Fellow that came along with me, and who
is design’d to marry a Sister of mine against my Will&mdash;And now I
think of him, <i>Gload</i>, where hast thou left this Master of
thine?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Glo.</span>
At the Inn, Sir, in as lamentable a Pickle, as if he were still in the
Storm; recruiting his emptyed Stomach with Brandy, and railing against
all Women-kind for your Sister’s sake, who has made him undertake this
Voyage.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lo.</span>
Well, I’ll come to him, go home before.
<span class = "stagedir">[Ex. <em>Gload</em>.</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Alon.</span>
Prithee what thing is this?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">228</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Lo.</span>
Why, ’tis the Cashier to this Squire I spoke of, a Man of Business, and
as wise as his Master, but the graver Coxcomb of the two. But this Lady,
<i>Alonzo</i>, who is this Lady thou speak’st of? shall not I know her?
We were wont to divide the Spoils of Beauty, as well as those of War
between&nbsp;us.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Alon.</span>
O but this is no such Prize, thou wouldst hardly share this with the
Danger, there’s Matrimony in the Case.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lo.</span>
Nay, then keep her to thy self, only let me know who ’tis that can
debauch thee to that scandalous way of Life; is she fair? will she
recompense the Folly?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Alon.</span>
Faith, I know not, I never saw her yet, but ’tis the Sister of
<i>Marcel</i>, whom we both knew last Summer in <i>Flanders</i>, and
where he and I contracted such a Friendship, that without other
Consideration he promis’d me <i>Hippolyta</i>, for that’s his Sister’s
Name.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lo.</span>
But wo’t thou really marry her?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Alon.</span>
I consider my Advantage in being allied to so considerable a Man as
<i>Ambrosio</i>, her Father; I&nbsp;being now so unhappy as not to know
my Birth or Parents.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lo.</span>
I have often heard of some such thing, but durst not ask the Truth
of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Alon.</span>
’Tis so, all that I know of my self is, that a <i>Spanish</i> Souldier,
who brought me up in the Army, dying, confest I was not his Son, (which
till then I believ’d) and at the Age of twelve left me to shift for my
self: the Fortune he inrich’d me with, was his Horse and Arms, with a
few Documents how to use them, as I had seen him do with good success:
This Servant, <span class = "aside">[Points to <em>Pedro</em>]</span>
and a Crucifix of Value. And from one Degree to another, I&nbsp;arriv’d
to what you knew me, Colonel of the Prince’s Regiment, and the Glory of
his Favour.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lo.</span>
Honour is the Child of Virtue, and finds an Owner every where.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Alon.</span>
Oh, Sir, you are a Courtier, and have much the odds of a Souldier in
Parleys of this nature: but hither I am come&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">229</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Lo.</span>
To be undone&mdash;Faith, thou look’st ill upon’t.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Alon.</span>
I confess I am not altogether so brisk as I should have been upon
another Occasion; you know, <i>Lovis</i>, I&nbsp;have been us’d to <a
class = "notes" name = "dutch_texttag3" id = "dutch_texttag3" href =
"#dutch_textnote3">Christian</a> Liberty, and hate this formal
Courtship. Pox on’t, wou’d ’twere over.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lo.</span>
Where all Parties are agreed, there’s little need of that; and the
Ladies of <i>Spain</i>, whatever Gravity they assume, are as ready as
any you ever met withal.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Alon.</span>
But there’s a damn’d Custom that does not at all agree with Men so frank
and gay as thou and I; there’s a deal of Danger in the Atchievement,
which some say heightens the Pleasure, but I am of another Opinion.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ped.</span>

Church.</p>

<i>An Epistle to the Reader.</i> This amusing and witty Epistle only
appears in the 4to, 1673, finding no place in the various collected
editions of Mrs. Behn’s plays. The writer of comedy&mdash;‘the most
severe of Johnson’s sect’&mdash;with his ‘musty rules of Unity’&mdash;at
whom she glances pretty freely is Shadwell, who had obtained great
success with <i>The Sullen Lovers</i> (produced 2&nbsp;May, 1668; 4to,
1668), and in spite of some mishaps and opposition, made another hit
with <i>The Humourists</i> (1671; 4to, 1671). An ardent disciple of Ben
Jonson, he had in the two printed prefaces to these plays belauded his
model beyond all other writers, insisting upon the Unities and the
introduction of at least two or three Humours as points essential to any
comedy.</p>

do just nothing at all; to laze. Laurence is the personification of
idleness. There are many dialect uses of the name, e.g., N.W. Devon
‘Lazy’s Laurence’, and Cornish ‘He’s as lazy as Lawrence’, vide Wright,

<i>Women must be watcht as Witches are.</i> One of the tests to which
beldames suspected of sorcery were put&mdash;a&nbsp;mode particularly
favoured by that arch-scamp, Matthew Hopkins, ‘Witch-Finder
General’&mdash;was to tie down the accused in some painful or at least
uneasy posture for twenty-four hours, during which time relays of
watchers sat round. It was supposed that an imp would come and suck the
witch’s blood; so any fly, moth, wasp or insect seen in the room was a
familiar in that shape, and the poor wretch was accordingly convicted of
the charge. Numerous confessions are recorded to have been extracted in
this manner from ailing and doting crones by Master Hopkins, cf.
<i>Hudribras</i>, Part II, canto iii, 146-8:&mdash;</p>

Porter, <i>A Witty Combat; or, The Female Victor</i> (4to, 1663).
Kirkman’s <i>Counterfeit Lady Unveiled</i> (8vo, 1673), contains very
ample details of her career. Pepys went to visit her ‘at the Gatehouse
at Westminster’, 29 May, 1663. In talk he was ‘high in the defence of
her wit and spirit’ (7&nbsp;June, 1663). 15 April, 1664, the diarist
further notes: ‘To the Duke’s house and there saw <i>The German
Princess</i> acted by the woman herself ... the whole play ... is very
simple, unless, here and there, a&nbsp;witty sprinkle or two.’ This

<h4><a name = "round_arg">ARGUMENT.</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> historical state of affairs
1659-60 was briefly as follows:&mdash;the Protectorate of Richard
Cromwell expired 22 April, 1659. Hereupon Fleetwood and some other
officers recalled the Long Parliament (Rump), which was constituted the
ruling power of England, a&nbsp;select council of state having the
executive. Lambert, however, with other dissentients was expelled from
Parliament, 12 October, 1659. He and his troops marched to Newcastle;
but the soldiers deserted him for General Fairfax, who had declared for
a free Parliament, and were garrisoned at York. Here Monk, entering
England 2&nbsp;January, 1660, joined them with his forces. Lambert,
deprived of his followers, was obliged to return to London. His prompt
arrest by order of Parliament followed, and he, Sir Harry Vane and other
members of the Committee of Safety were placed in strict confinement. On
5&nbsp;March Lambert was imprisoned in the Tower, whence he escaped on
10 April, only to be recaptured a fortnight later. There are vivid
pictures in Aubrey, Pepys, and other writers, of the wild enthusiasm at
the fall of the Rump Parliament, with bonfires blazing, all the church
bells ringing, and the populace of London carousing and pledging King
Charles on their knees in the street. ‘They made little gibbets and
roasted rumps of mutton. Nay, I&nbsp;saw some very good rumps of beef,’
writes Aubrey, and Pepys is even more vivid in his tale than the good
antiquary.</p>

<p>King Charles landed at Dover, 26 May, amid universal rejoicings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Behn has (quite legitimately) made considerable departures from
strict historical fact and the sequence of events for her dramatic
purposes.</p>

<p>Lambert and Fleetwood are scheming for the supreme power, and both
intrigue with Lord Wariston, the chairman of the Committee of Safety,
for his good word and influence. Lambert meantime fools Fleetwood by
flattery and a feigned indifference. Lady Lambert, who is eagerly
expecting her husband to be proclaimed King, and is assuming the state
and title of royalty to the anger of Cromwell’s widow, falls in love
with a cavalier, Loveless. Her friend, Lady Desbro’, a&nbsp;thorough
loyalist at heart, though wedded to an old parliamentarian, has long
been enamoured of Freeman, the cavalier’s companion. Lambert surprises
Loveless and Freeman with his wife and Lady Desbro’, but Lady Lambert
pretending they have come to petition her, abruptly dismisses them both
and so assuages all suspicion. At a meeting of the Committee the two
gallants are sent to prison for a loyal outburst on the part of
Loveless. Ananias Goggle, a&nbsp;lay elder, who having offered liberties
to Lady Desbro’ is in her power, is by her obliged to obtain her lover’s
release, and she at once holds an interview with him. They are
interrupted by Desbro’ himself, but Freeman is concealed and makes an
undiscovered exit behind the shelter of Goggle’s flowing cloak.</p>

<p>Loveless is brought to Lady Lambert at night. She endeavours to
dazzle him by showing the regalia richly set out and adorned with
lights. He puts by, however, crown and sceptre and rebukes her
overweening ambition. Suddenly the Committee, who have been drinking
deep, burst
<span class = "pagenum">334</span>
in upon them dancing a riotous dance. Loveless is hurriedly concealed
under the coverlet of a couch, and Lady Lambert sits thereon seemingly
at her devotions. Her husband takes his place by her side, but rolls off
as the gallant slips to the ground. The lights fall down and are
extinguished, the men fly howling and bawling ‘A&nbsp;Plot!
A&nbsp;Plot!’ in drunken terror. Lambert is cajoled and hectored into
believing himself mistaken owing to his potations. The ladies hold a
council to correct and enquire into women’s wrongs, but on a sudden,
news is brought that Lambert’s followers have turned against him and
that he is imprisoned in the Tower. The city rises against the
Parliament and the Rump is dissolved. Loveless and Freeman rescue Lady
Lambert and Lady Desbro’, whose old husband has fallen down dead with
fright. The parliamentarians endeavour to escape, but Wariston, Goggle,
and Hewson&mdash;a&nbsp;leading member of the Committee&mdash;are
detected and maltreated by the mob. As they are haled away to prison the
people give themselves up to general merry-making and joy.</p>




<h4><a name = "round_source">SOURCE.</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> purely political part of <i>The
Roundheads; or, The Good Old Cause</i> was founded by Mrs. Behn on John
Tatham’s <i>The Rump</i>; or, <i>The Mirror of the Late Times</i> (4to,
1660, 4to, 1661, and again 1879 in his collected works,) which was
produced on the eve of the Restoration, in February, 1660, at the
Private House, i.e. small theatre, in Dorset Court. The company which
played here had been brought together by William Beeston, but singularly
little is known of its brief career and only one name has been recorded,
that of George Jolly, the leading actor. Tatham was the author of the
Lord Mayor’s pageants 1657-64. His plays, four in number, together with
a rare entertainment, <i>London’s Glory</i> (1660), have been well
edited by Maidment and Logan.</p>

<p><i>The Rump</i> met with great success. It is certainly a brisk and
lively piece, and coming at the juncture it did must have been
extraordinarily effective. As a topical key-play reflecting the moment
it is indeed admirable, and the crescendo of overwhelming satire, all
the keener for the poet’s deep earnestness, culminating in the living
actors, yesterday’s lords and law-givers, running to and fro the London
streets, one bawling ‘Ink or pens, ink or pens!’, another ‘Boots or
shoes, boots or shoes to mend!’, a&nbsp;third ‘Fine Seville oranges,
fine lemons!’, whilst Mrs. Cromwell exchanges Billingsgate with a crowd
of jeering boys, must have caused the house absolutely to rock with
merriment.</p>

<p>With all its point and cleverness <i>The Rump</i>, however, from a
technical point of view, is ill-digested and rough. The scenes were
evidently thrown off hastily, and sadly lack refining and revision. Mrs.
Behn has made the happiest use of rather unpromising material. The
intrigues between Loveless and Lady Lambert, who in Tatham is very <ins
class = "correction" title = "text unchanged">woodeny</ins> and awkward,
between Freeman and Lady Desbro’, which give <i>The Roundheads</i> unity
and dramatic point, are entirely her own invention. In the original
<i>Rump</i> neither cavaliers nor Lady Desbro’ appear. Ananias Goggle
also, the canting lay elder of Clements, with his subtle casuistry that
jibs at ‘the person not the office,’ a dexterous character sketch, alive
and acute, we owe to Mrs. Behn.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">335</span>
Amongst the many plays, far too numerous even to catalogue, that scarify
the puritans and their zealot tribe, <i>The Cheats</i> (1662), by
Wilson, and Sir Robert Howard’s <i>The Committee</i> (1662), which long
kept the stage, and, in a modified form, <i>The Honest Thieves</i>, was
seen as late as the second half of the nineteenth century, are
pre-eminently the best. Both possess considerable merit and are worthy
of the highest comic traditions of the theatre.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, the dissolution of the Rump Parliament
let loose a flood of political literature, squibs, satires and lampoons.
Such works as <i>The famous Tragedie of the Life and Death of Mrs. Rump
... as it was presented on a burning stage at Westminster, the 29th of
May, 1660</i> (4to, 1660), are of course valueless save from a purely
historical interest. A&nbsp;large number of songs and ballads were
brought together and published in two parts, 1662, reprint 1874. This
collection (<i>The Rump</i>), sometimes witty, sometimes angry,
sometimes obscene, is weighty evidence of the loathing inspired by the
republicans and their misrule, but it is of so personal and topical a
nature that the allusions would hardly be understood by any one who had
not made a very close and extended study of those critical months.</p>




<h4><a name = "round_hist">THEATRICAL HISTORY.</a></h4>


<p><i>The Roundheads; or, The Good Old Cause</i> was produced at the
Duke’s Theatre in 1682. They were unsettled and hazardous times. The
country was convulsed by the judicial murders and horrors which followed
in the train of the pseudo-Popish Plot engineered by the abominable
Gates and his accomplices. King and Parliament were at hopeless
variance. The air was charged with strife, internecine hatreds and
unrest. In such an atmosphere and in such circumstances politics could
not but make themselves keenly felt upon the stage. The actors were
indeed ‘abstracts and brief chronicles of the time’, and the theatre
became a very Armageddon for the poets. As <i>A Lenten Prologue refus’d
by the Players</i> (1682) puts it:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
’Plots and Parties give new matter birth<br>
And State distractions serve you here for mirth!<br>
<span class = "padding">&nbsp;.......</span><br>
The Stage, like old Rump Pulpits, is become<br>
The scene of News, a furious Party’s drum.’</p>

<p>Produced on 4 December, 1682, Dryden and Lee’s excellent Tragedy,
<i>The Duke of Guise</i>, which the Whigs vainly tried to suppress,
created a furore. Crowne’s <i>City Politics</i> (1683) is a crushing
satire, caricaturing Oates, Stephen College, old Sergeant Maynard and
their faction with rare skill. Southerne’s <i>Loyal Brother</i> (1682),
eulogizes the Duke of York; the scope of D’Urfey’s <i>Sir Barnaby
Whigg</i> (1681), can be told by its title, indeed the prologue says of
the author:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
’That he shall know both parties now he glories,<br>
By hisses th’ Whigs, and by their claps the Tories.’</p>

<p>His <i>Royalist</i> (1682) follows in the same track.</p>

<p>Even those plays which were entirely non-political are inevitably
prefaced with a mordant prologue or wound up by an epilogue that has
party venom and mustard in its tail.</p>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">336</span>
It would be surprising if so popular a writer as Mrs. Behn had not put a
political play on the stage at such a juncture, and we find her well to
the fore with <i>The Roundheads</i>, which she followed up in the same
year with <i>The City Heiress</i>, another openly topical comedy.</p>

<p>The cast of <i>The Roundheads</i> is not given in any printed copy,
and we have no exact means of apportioning the characters, which must
have entailed the whole comic strength of the house. It is known that
Betterton largely refrained from appearing in political comedies, and no
doubt Smith took the part of Loveless, whilst Freeman would have fallen
to Joseph Williams. Nokes was certainly Lambert; and Leigh, Wariston.
Mrs. Leigh probably played Lady Cromwell or Gilliflower; Mrs. Barry,
Lady Lambert; and Mrs. Currer, Lady Desbro’. The piece seems to have
been very successful, and to have kept the stage at intervals for some
twenty years.</p>

the faint shadow of their own deformity) their <i>Rebellion, Murders,
Massacres</i> and <i>Villanies</i>, from forty upwards, <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘ahould’">should</ins> be represented
for the better undeceiving and informing of the World, flock in a full
Assembly with a pious design to Hiss and Rail it as much out of
countenance as they would <i>Monarchy, Religion, Laws</i>, and
<i>Honesty</i>; throwing the <i>Act of Oblivion</i> in our Teeths, as if
that (whose mercy cannot make them forget their old Rebellion) cou’d
hinder honest Truths from breaking out upon ’em in Edifying Plays, where
the Loyal hands ever out-do their venom’d Hiss; a&nbsp;good and happy
Omen, if Poets may be allow’d for Prophets as of old they were: and ’tis
as easily seen at a new Play how the Royal Interest thrives, as at a
City Election, how the <a class = "notes" name = "round_texttag2" id =
"round_texttag2" href = "#round_textnote2"><i>Good Old Couse</i></a> is
carried on; as a Noble Peer lately said, <i>Tho’ the Tories have got the
better of us at the Play, we carried it in the City by many Voices, God
be praised!</i></p>

<p>This Play, call’d <i>The Roundheads</i>, which I humbly lay at your
Graces feet, Pardon the Title, and Heaven defend you from the bloody
Race, was carried in the House <i>nemine contra dicente</i>, by the
Royal Party, and under your Grace’s Illustrious Patronage is safe from
any new Seditious affronts abroad; Your Grace alone, whom Heaven and
Nature has form’d the most
<span class = "pagenum">338</span>
adorable Person in the whole Creation, with all the advantages of a
glorious Birth, has a double right and power to defend all that approach
you for sanctuary; your very Beauty is a Guard to all you daigne to make
safe: for You were born for Conquest every way; even what
<i>Phanatick</i>, what peevish <i>Politician</i>, testy with <i>Age,
Diseases</i>, miscarried <i>Plots</i>, disappointed <i>Revolutions</i>,
envious of <i>Power</i>, of <i>Princes</i>, and of <i>Monarchy</i>, and
mad with <i>Zeal</i> for <i>Change</i> and <i>Reformation</i>, could yet
be so far lost to sense of Pleasure, as not to turn a Rebel to Revenge
the <i>Good old Cause</i>, and the patronage to <i>Plebean</i> sedition
with only looking on you, ’twou’d force his meger face to blushing
smiles, and make him swear he had mistook the side, curse his own Party,
and if possible, be reconciled to Honesty again: such power have charms
like Yours to calm the soul, and will in spight of You plead for me to
the disaffected, even when they are at Wars with your Birth and Power.
But this <i>Play</i>, for which I humbly beg your Grace’s Protection,
needs it in a more peculiar manner, it having drawn down Legions upon
its head, for its Loyalty&mdash;<i>what, to Name us</i> cries one,
<i>’tis most abominable, unheard of daring</i> cries
another&mdash;<i>she deserves to be swing’d</i> cries a third; as if
twere all a Libel, a&nbsp;Scandal impossible to be prov’d, or that their
Rogueries were of so old a Date their Reign were past Remembrance or
History; when they take such zealous care to renew it daily to our
memories: And I am satisfied, that they that will justifie the best of
these Traytors, deserves the fate of the worst, and most manifestly
declare to the World by it, they wou’d be at the <i>Old Game</i> their
fore-Fathers play’d with so good success: yet if there be any honest
loyal man allied to any here nam’d, I&nbsp;heartily beg his pardon for
any offensive Truth I have spoken, and ’tis a wonderful thing that
amongst so Numerous a Flock they will not allow of one mangy Sheep; not
one Rogue in the whole Generation of the Association.</p>

<p>But as they are I leave ’em to your Grace to Judge of ’em; to whom I
humbly present this small Mirror, of the late wretched Times: wherein
your Grace may see something of the Miseries three the Most Glorious
Kingdoms of the Universe were reduc’d to; where your Royal Ancestors
victoriously Reign’d for so many hundred years: How they were Governed,
Parcell’d out, and deplorably inslav’d, and to what Low, Prostituted
Lewdness they fell at last: where the Nobility and Gentry were the most
contemn’d and despis’d part of them, and such Meane (and till then
obscure) Villains Rul’d, and Tyrannized, that no <i>Age</i>, nor
<i>Time</i>, or scarce a Parish Book makes mentions or cou’d show there
was any such Name or Family. Yet these were those that impudently Tug’d
for Empire, and Prophan’d that illustrious Throne and Court, so due
then, and possest now (through the infinite Mercies of God to this
bleeding Nation) by the best of Monarchs;
<span class = "pagenum">339</span>
a Monarch, who had the divine goodness to Pardon even his worst of
Enemies what was past; Nay, out of his Vast and God-like Clemency, did
more than Heaven it self can do, put it out of his Power by <i>an Act of
Oblivion</i>, to punish the unparalell’d Injuries done His Sacred
Person, and the rest of the Royal Family: How great his Patience has
been since, I&nbsp;leave to all the World to judge: but Heaven be
prais’d, he has not yet forgot the Sufferings and Murders of the
Glorious Martyr of ever Blessed memory, Your Graces Sacred Grandfather,
and by what Arts and Ways that Devilish Plot was layed! and will like a
skilful Pilate, by the wreck of one Rich Vessel, learn how to shun the
danger of this present Threatning and save the rest from sinking; The
Clouds already begin to disappear, and the face of things to change,
thanks to Heaven, his Majesties infinite Wisdom, and the Over-Zeal of
the (falsly called) <i>True Protestant Party</i>; Now we may pray for
the King and his Royal Brother, defend his Cause, and assert his Right,
without the fear of a taste of the Old Sequestration call’d a
<i>Fine</i>; Guard the Illustrious Pair, good Heaven, from Hellish
Plots, and all the Devilish Machinations of Factious Cruelties: and you,
great Sir, (whose Merits have so Justly deserv’d that glorious Command
so lately trusted to your Care, which Heaven increase, and make your
glad Regiment Armies for our safety. May you become the great Example of
Loyalty and Obedience, and stand a firm and unmoveable Pillar to
<i>Monarchy</i>, a&nbsp;Noble Bullwark to <i>Majesty</i>; defend the
Sacred Cause, imploy all that Youth, Courage, and Noble Conduct which
God and Nature purposely has endued you with, to serve the Royal
Interest: You, Sir, who are obliged by a double Duty to Love, Honour,
and Obey his Majesty, both as a Father and a King! O&nbsp;undissolvable
Knot! O&nbsp;Sacred Union! what Duty, what Love, what Adoration can
express or repay the Debt we owe the first, or the Allegiance due to the
last, but where both meet in one, to make the Tye Eternal; Oh what
Counsel, what Love of Power, what fancied Dreams of Empire, what fickle
Popularity can inspire the heart of Man, or any Noble mind, with
Sacrilegious thoughts against it, can harbour or conceive a stubborn
disobedience: Oh what Son can desert the Cause of an Indulgent Parent,
what Subject, of such a Prince, without renouncing the Glory of his
Birth, his Loyalty, and good Nature.</p>

<p>Ah Royal lovely Youth! beware of false Ambition; wisely believe your
Elevated Glory, (at&nbsp;least) more happy then a Kings, you share their
Joys, their pleasures and magnificence, without the toils and business
of a <i>Monarch</i>, their carefull days and restless thoughtfull
nights; know, you art blest with all that Heaven can give, or you can
wish; your Mind and Person such, so excellent, that Love knows no fault
it would wish to mend, nor Envy to increase! blest with a Princess of
such undisputable charming Beauty, as if
<span class = "pagenum">340</span>
Heaven, designing to take a peculiar care in all that concerns your
Happiness, had form’d her on purpose, to compleat&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Hail happy glorious Pair! the perfect joy and pleasure of all that
look on ye, for whom all Tongues and Hearts have Prayers and Blessings;
May you out-live Sedition, and see your Princely Race as Numerous as

<i>To the Right Noble Henry Fitzroy.</i> Second son of Charles II by
Barbara Villiers, Countess of Castlemaine, afterwards Duchess of
Cleveland, was born 20 September, 1663. He married, 1&nbsp;August, 1672,
Isabella, daughter and heiress of Henry Bennet, Earl of Arlington. The
bride was then only five years old. In September, 1675, Henry Fitzroy
was created Duke of Grafton, and on 30 September, 1680, was installed by
proxy as Knight of the Garter. In 1682 he
<span class = "pagenum notes">451</span>
became colonel of the first foot guards. He died 9 October, 1690, from a
wound he received under the walls of Cork during Marlborough’s
expedition to Ireland. Brave and even reckless to a fault, he is said to
have been the most popular and the ablest of the sons of
Charles&nbsp;II.</p>

<i>Fleetwood.</i> Lieutenant-General Charles Fleetwood was son-in-law to
Oliver Cromwell, and for a time Lord-Deputy of Ireland. He was mainly
instrumental in the resignation of Richard Cromwell, but so weak and
vacillating that he lost favour with all parties. His name was excepted
from the general amnesty, and it was only with great difficulty that,
owing to the influence of Lord Litchfield, he escaped with his life. He
died in obscurity at Stoke Newington, 4&nbsp;October, 1692.</p>

<i>Lambert.</i> Major-General Lambert (1619-83) lost his commissions
owing to the jealousy of Oliver Cromwell, on whose death he privily
opposed Richard Cromwell. In August, 1659, he defeated the Royalist
forces under Sir George Booth in Cheshire, but subsequently his army
deserted. On his return to London he was arrested (5&nbsp;March, 1660),
by the Parliament, but escaped. Tried for high treason at the
Restoration, he was banished to Guernsey, where he died in the winter of
1683.</p>

was parliamentary commissioner for the administration of justice in
Scotland and a member of Cromwell’s House of Peers. On the revival of
the Rump he became president of the Council of State, and permanent
president of the Committee of Safety. At the Restoration he fled, but
was brought back from Rouen to be hanged at the Market Cross, Edinburgh,
23 July, 1663. Carlyle dubs him a ‘lynx-eyed lawyer and austere
presbyterian zealot’, and Burnet says, ‘Presbyterianism was more to him
than all the world.’</p>

another account, at Rouen.</p>

Cromwell’s brother-in-law. Being left a widower, he married again April,
1658. As he had refused to sit as a judge at the trial of Charles I, he
was not exempted from the amnesty; but being considered a source of
danger, he was, after the Restoration, ‘always watched with peculiar
jealousy,’ and suffered some short term of imprisonment.</p>

Parliamentarian, but one who refused to assist at the King’s trial. He
had large estates in Cheshire, where he lived retired after a short
imprisonment at the Restoration. His son Robert, who succeeded him, was
subsequently created a baronet by Charles II, 16 June, 1665.</p>

Cobbet occurs Act i, II (p.&nbsp;355), and we have Cobbet again Act iii,

regicide, but Ralph Cobbet, who was both a colonel and a member of the
Committee of Safety. Ralph Cobbet is frequently alluded to in the
satires of the time, e.g. <i>The Gang; or, The Nine Worthies and

Seal, and in August, 1659, president of the Council of State, was always
inclined to royalism, and even advised Cromwell to restore Charles II.
At the Restoration he was allowed to retire to Chilton Park, Hungerford,
Wilts, and died there 28 July, 1675. According to some accounts his
death took place at Fawley, Bucks.</p>

<i>Lady Lambert.</i> Lady Lambert was Frances, daughter of Sir William
Lister, knight, of Thornton in Craven, Yorks. She was married 10
September, 1639. Contemporaries attribute Lambert’s ambition to the
influence of his wife, whose pride is frequently alluded to. e.g.
<i>Memoirs of Colonel Hutchinson</i>, edited by C.&nbsp;H. Firth (Nimmo,
1885), Vol.&nbsp;II, p.&nbsp;189, ‘There went a story that as my Lady
Ireton was walking in St. James’ Park the Lady Lambert, as proud as her
husband, came by where she was, and as the present princess always has
precedency of the relict of the dead prince, so she put my Lady Ireton
below; who, notwithstanding her piety and humility, was a little grieved
at the affront.’</p>

daughter of Sir Richard Everard, Bart., of Much Waltham. Mrs. Behn’s
amorous lady, Maria, is, of course, purely fictional.</p>

buried at S.&nbsp;Anne’s, Blackfriars, 1&nbsp;July, 1662.</p>

Norboro’, Northamptonshire, the house of her son-in-law, John

<i>Clement’s Parish.</i> Probably St. Clements, Eastcheap. This church,
described by Stow as being ‘small and void of monuments’, was destroyed
in the Great Fire and rebuilt 1686. The old church of St. Clement Danes,
Strand, being in a ruinous condition, was pulled down in 1680 and built
again on the same site. The Puritans always omitted the prefix ‘St.’ and
spoke of churches as ‘Paul’s’, ‘Mary’s’, ‘Bartholomew’s’, ‘Helen’s’ and
the like.</p>

and Lambert’s wife is affirmed in ‘<i>Newes from the New Exchange; or,

without grace, 1650’ (4to). Noble, in his <i>Memoirs of the Cromwell
Family</i> (8vo, London, 1787, 3rd edit., Vol.&nbsp;II, p.&nbsp;369),
says that the lady ‘was an elegant and accomplished woman’, she was
‘suppos’d to have been partial to Oliver the Protector.’ A scarce poem,

Noll ‘fell on his neck, kissed him, inquired of dear Johnny for his

notorious. Although the parish registers of S.&nbsp;John’s, Huntingdon,
have been tampered with, the following, under the years 1621 and 1628,
remain: ‘Oliverus Cromwell reprehensus erat coram tota Ecclesia pro

<i>Needham.</i> Marchamont Nedham, ‘the Commonwealth’s Didaper’, was a
graduate of All Souls, Oxon, and sometime an usher at Merchant Taylors’
school. He also seems to have been connected with the legal profession.
‘The skip-jack of all fortunes’, neither side has a good word for this
notorious pamphleteer, the very scum of our early journalism. When
<i>Mercurius Britannicus</i> temporarily ceased publication with No. 50,
9&nbsp;September, 1644, Nedham recommenced it on the 30th of the same
month with No. 51 (not No. 52 as is sometimes stated). No. 92, 28 July-4
August, 1645, and the number 11-18 May, 1646, revile the King in such
scurrilous terms that Nedham was haled to the bar of the House of Lords
and imprisoned. Later he turned Royalist, but in 1650 published <i>The
Case of the Commonwealth Stated</i>, a&nbsp;defence of the regicides,
for which he received a pension of £100 a year. He fled to Holland,
April, 1660, but being pardoned, returned to England. He died in
Devereux Court, Temple Bar, November, 1678, and is buried in St. Clement
Danes. Wood characterizes him as ‘a most seditious, mutable and railing
author,’ whilst Cleveland terms him ‘that impudent and incorrigible
reviler’.</p>

fate was happier than that of the Dauphin committed to the cruelties of
Citizen Simon, cordwainer.</p>

<i>Highness’s Funeral.</i> A large portion of the debt incurred for
Oliver Cromwell’s magnificently extravagant funeral ceremonies fell on
Richard, who was obliged to retire for a while to the continent to avoid
arrest and await some settlement. These obsequies cost in all the huge
sum of £60,000, which there was a great difficulty in paying. The chief
undertaker’s name was Rolt. See note on <i>The Widow Ranter</i> &mdash;
‘Trusting for Old Oliver’s funeral,’ Act i. (Vol.&nbsp;IV.)</p>

<i>Walter Frost.</i> Walter Frost, secretary to the Republican Council
of State, was quondam manciple of Emmanuel, Cambridge, and acted as
spy-master and manager of the ‘committee hackneys,’ which hunted down
and betrayed Royalists. This infamous fellow, who dubbed himself Esquire
and Latinized his name to Gualter, was authorized to publish (i.e.
write) ‘intelligence every week upon Thursday according to an Act of
Parliament for that purpose.’ He licensed <i>A Briefe Relation</i>
(No&nbsp;1, 2&nbsp;October, 1649) from its second number until 22
October, 1650. This is certainly one of the most evil and lying of the
Republican diurnals.</p>

Whitelocke actually had obtained the Duke’s sequestered estate, and
stood for Bucks in Parliament. During the Commonwealth Chelsea House was
bestowed upon him as an official residence, and he lived there till the
Restoration, when it reverted to the Duke, to whose father it had been
granted in 1627 by Charles I. He sold it in 1664 to the trustees of
George Digby, Earl of Bristol. In 1682 it became the property of Henry,
Marquis of Worcester, afterwards Duke of Beaufort, and was renamed
Beaufort House. Sir Hans Sloane purchased it in 1738, and it was
demolished two years later.</p>

<i>The Tall Irishman.</i> Oliver Cromwell’s porter, yclept Daniel, was a
giant. This fellow, through poring over mystical divinity, lost his
wits: he preached, prophesied, and raved until finally he was
incarcerated in Bedlam, where, after a while, his liberty was allowed
him. A&nbsp;famous item amongst his books was a large Bible presented by
Neil Gwynne. D’Urfey in his Prologue to <i>Sir Barnaby Whigg</i> (1681),
has: ‘Like Oliver’s porter, but not so devout.’ There is a rare, if not
unique, portrait of Daniel in the Print Room, British Museum. The
reputed portrait in Pierce Tempest’s <i>Cryes of the City of London</i>
(No. 71. Un insensé pour la Religion. M.&nbsp;Lauron del.
P.&nbsp;Tempest ex.) is not that of a remarkably tall man.</p>

<i>an act, <ins class = "correction"
title = "body text reads ‘June 24th’">24 June</ins>.</i> Cromwell’s
parliament passed Draconian Acts punishing adultery, incest,
fornication, with death; the two former on the first offence, the last
on the second conviction. <i>Mercurius Politicus</i>, No. 168. Thursday,
25 August&mdash; Thursday, 1&nbsp;September, 1653 (p.&nbsp;2700),
records the execution of an old man of eighty-nine who was found guilty
at Monmouth Assize of adultery with a woman over sixty. It is well known
that under the Commonwealth the outskirts of London were crowded with
brothels, and the license of Restoration days pales before the moral
evils and cankers existing under Cromwell. The officially recognized
independent diurnals <i>Mercurius Democritus</i>, <i>Mercurius
Fumigosus</i>, have been described as ‘abominable’. In 1660, when the
writers of these attempted to circulate literature which had been common
in the preceeding decade, they were promptly ‘clapt up in Newgate’.</p>

even a Leveller. He was a commissioner of the High Court of Justice and
a regicide. At the Restoration he was imprisoned for life and died at
Chepstow Castle, 1681, aged seventy-eight. He was notorious for
profligacy and shamelessness, and kept a very seraglio of
mistresses.</p>

The bells began at five in the morning. This church was largely attended
by fanatics and extremists. There are frequent allusions to St.
Antholin’s and its matutinal chimes. The church was burned down in the
Great Fire. Middleton and Dekker’s <i>Roaring Girl</i> (1611): ‘Sha’s a

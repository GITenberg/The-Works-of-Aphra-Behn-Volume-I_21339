<h4><a name = "rover1_arg">ARGUMENT.</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">During</span>
the exile of Charles II a band of cavaliers, prominent amongst whom are
Willmore (the Rover), Belvile, Frederick, and Ned Blunt, find themselves
at Naples in carnival time. Belvile, who at a siege at Pampluna has
rescued a certain Florinda and her brother Don Pedro, now loves the
lady, and the tender feeling is reciprocated. Florinda’s father,
however, designs her for the elderly Vincentio, whilst her brother would
have her marry his friend Antonio, son to the Viceroy. Florinda, her
sister Hellena (who is intended for the veil), their cousin Valeria, and
duenna Callis surreptitiously visit the carnival, all in masquerade, and
there encounter the cavaliers. Florinda arranges to meet Belvile that
night at her garden-gate. Meanwhile a picture of Angelica Bianca,
a&nbsp;famous courtezan, is publicly exposed, guarded by bravos. Antonio
and Pedro dispute who shall give the 1000 crowns she demands, and come
to blows. After a short fray Willmore, who has boldly pulled down the
picture, is admitted to the house, and declares his love, together with
his complete inability to pay the price she requires. Angelica, none the
less, overcome with passion, yields to him. Shortly after, meeting
Hellena in the street, he commences an ardent courtship, which is
detected by the jealous Angelica, who has followed him vizarded.
Florinda that night at the garden-gate encounters Willmore, who, having
been toping in the town, is far from sober, and her cries at his
advances attract her brother and servants, whom she eludes by escaping
back to the house. After a brawl, Willmore has to endure the reproaches
of Belvile, who has appeared on the scene. During their discussion
Antonio makes as about to enter Angelica’s house before which they are,
and Willmore, <ins class = "correction" title = "standard spelling for this text">justling</ins>
him to one side, wounds him. He falls, and the
officers who run up at the clash of swords, arrest Belvile, who has
returned at the noise, as the assailant, conveying him by Antonio’s
orders to the Viceroy’s palace. Antonio, in the course of conversation,
resigns Florinda to his rival, and Belvile, disguised as Antonio,
obtains Florinda from Don Pedro. At this moment Willmore accosts him,
and the Spaniard perceiving his mistake, soon takes his sister off home.
Angelica next comes in hot pursuit of Willmore, but they are interrupted
by Hellena, dressed as a boy, who tells a tale of the Rover’s amour with
another dame and so rouses the jealous courtezan to fury, and the twain
promptly part quarrelling. Florinda, meanwhile, who has escaped from her
brother, running into an open house to evade detection, finds herself in
Ned Blunt’s apartments. Blunt, who is sitting half-clad, and in no
pleasant mood owing to his having been tricked of clothes and money and
turned into the street by a common cyprian, greets her roughly enough,
but is mollified by the present of a diamond ring. His friends and Don
Pedro, come to laugh at his sorry case, now force their way into the
chamber, and Florinda, whom her brother finally resigns to Belvile, is
discovered. She is straightway united to her lover by a convenient
priest. Willmore is then surprised by the apparition of Angelica, who,
loading him with bitter reproaches for his infidelity, is about to
pistol him, when she is disarmed by Antonio, and accordingly parts in a
fury of jealous rage, to give place to Hellena who adroitly secures her
Rover in the noose of matrimony.</p>

<h4><a name = "rover1_source">SOURCE.</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span>
entire plan and many details of both parts of <i>The Rover</i> are taken
openly and unreservedly from Tom Killigrew’s <i>Thomaso, or The
Wanderer</i>, an unacted comedy likewise in two parts, published for the
first time in his collected works by Henry Herringman (folio, 1663-4).
It is to be noticed, however, that whilst Killigrew’s work is really one
long play of ten closely consecutive acts, the scene of which is
continually laid in Madrid, without any break in time or action, Mrs.
Behn, on the other hand, admirably contrives that each separate part of
<i>The Rover</i> is complete and possesses perfect unity in itself, the
locale being respectively, and far more suitably, in two several places,
Naples and Madrid, rather than confined to the latter city alone. Mrs.
Behn, moreover, introduces new characters and a new intrigue in her
second part, thus not merely sustaining but even renewing the interest
which in <i>Thomaso</i> jades and flags most wearily owing to the
author’s prolixity and diffuseness.</p>

<p>Killigrew, a royalist to the core, participated in the protracted
exile of Charles II, and devoting this interim to literature, wrote
<i>Thomaso</i> whilst at Madrid, probably about the year 1654-5.
Although undeniably interesting in a high degree, and not ill written,
it shares in no small measure the salient faults of his other
productions, boundless and needless verbosity, slowness of action,
unconscionable length.</p>

<p>For all its wit and cleverness, such blemishes would, without
trenchant cutting, have been more than sufficient to prohibit it from
any actual performance, and, indeed, <i>Thomaso</i> may be better
described as a dramatic romance than a comedy intended for the boards.
Clumsy and gargantuan speeches, which few actors could have even
memorized, and none would have ventured to utter on the stage, abound in
every scene. This lack of technical acumen (unless, as may well be the
case, Killigrew wrote much of these plays without any thought of
presentation) is more than surprising in an author so intimately
connected with the theatre and, after the Restoration, himself manager
of the King’s Company.</p>

<p>Nor is <i>Thomaso</i> without its patent plagiarisms. Doubtless no
small part is simply autobiographical adventuring, but, beside many a
reminiscence of the later Jacobeans, Killigrew has conveyed entire
passages and lyrics wholesale without attempt at disguise. Thus the
song, ‘Come hither, you that love,’ Act&nbsp;ii, Scene&nbsp;3, is from
Fletcher’s <i>Captain</i>, Act&nbsp;iv, the scene in Lelia’s chamber.
Again, the procedure and orations of Lopus the mountebank are but the
flimsiest alterations of <i>Volpone</i>, Act&nbsp;ii, Scene&nbsp;I, nor
could Killigrew change Jonson for anything but the worse. He has even
gone so far as to name his quack’s spouse Celia, a&nbsp;distinct echo of
Corvino’s wife.</p>

<p>In dealing with these two plays Mrs. Behn has done a great deal more
than merely fit the pieces for the stage. Almost wholly rewriting them,
she has infused into the torpid dialogue no small portion of wit and
vivacity, whilst the characters, prone to devolve into little better
than prosy and wooden marionettes, with only too apparent wires, are
given life, vigour movement, individuality and being. In fact she has
made the whole completely and essentially her own. In some cases the
same names are retained. We find Phillipo, Sancho, Angelica Bianca,
Lucetta, Callis, in Killigrew. But as Willmore is a different thing
altogether to Thomaso, so Ned Blunt is an
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
infinitely more entertaining figure than his prototype Edwardo. Amongst
other details Killigrew, oddly and stupidly enough, gives his English
gentlemen foreign names:&mdash;Thomaso, Ferdinando, Rogero,
Harrigo<a class = "tag" name = "rover1_tag1" id = "rover1_tag1"
href = "#rover1_note1">*</a>. This jar is duly corrected in <i>The
Rover</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. Behn has further dealt with the Lucetta intrigue in a far more
masterly way than Killigrew’s clumsily developed episode. In
<i>Thomaso</i> it occupies a considerable space, and becomes both
tedious and brutally unpleasant. The apt conclusion of the amour in
<i>The Rover</i> with Blunt’s parlous mishap is originally derived from
Boccaccio, Second Day, Novel&nbsp;5, where a certain Andreuccio finds
himself in the same unsavoury predicament as the Essex squireen.
However, even this was by no means new to the English stage. In <i>Blurt
Master Constable</i>, Lazarillo de Tormes, at the house of the courtezan
Imperia, meets with precisely the same accident, Act&nbsp;iii,
Scene&nbsp;3, Act&nbsp;iv, Scenes 2 and&nbsp;3, and it is probable that
Mrs. Behn did not go directly to the <i>Decameron</i> but drew upon
Middleton, of whom she made very ample use on another occasion,
borrowing for <i>The City Heiress</i> no small portion of <i>A Mad
World, My Masters</i>, and racily reproducing in extenso therefrom Sir
Bounteous Progress, Dick Folly-Wit, the mock grandee, and that most
excellent of all burglaries good enough for Fielding at his best.</p>

<p>In dealing with <i>Thomaso</i> Astrea did not hesitate, with manifest
advantage, to transfer incidents from Part&nbsp;II to Part&nbsp;I, and
vice versa. Correcting, pruning, augmenting, enlivening, rewriting, she
may indeed (pace the memory of the merry jester of Charles&nbsp;II) be
well said to have clothed dry bones with flesh, and to have given her
creation a witty and supple tongue.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a name = "rover1_note1" id = "rover1_note1" href = "#rover1_tag1">*</a>
There is a strange commixture here. The character is familiarly
addressed as ‘Hal’, the scene is Madrid, and he rejoices in the Milanese
(not Italian) nomenclature Arrigo&nbsp;= Henry in that dialect.</p>




<h4><a name = "rover1_hist">THEATRICAL HISTORY.</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span>
first part of <i>The Rover</i> was produced at the Duke’s House, Dorset
Gardens, in the summer of 1677, and licensed for printing on 2&nbsp;July
of the same year. It met, as it fully deserved, with complete success,
and remained one of the stock plays of the company. Smith, the original
Willmore, and the low comedian Underhill as Blunt were especially
renowned in their respective rôles. Another famous Willmore was Will
Mountford, of whom Dibdin relates, ‘When he played Mrs. Behn’s dissolute
character of The Rover, it was remarked by many, and particularly by
Queen Mary, that it was dangerous to see him act, he made vice so
alluring.’</p>

<p>Amongst the more notable representations of the eighteenth century we
find:&mdash; <i>Drury Lane; 18 February, 1703.</i> Willmore by Wilks;
Hellena, Mrs. Oldfield; repeated on 15 October of the same year.
<i>Haymarket; 20 January, 1707.</i> Willmore by Verbruggen; Blunt,
Underhill; Hellena, Mrs. Bracegirdle; Angelica, Mrs. Barry; Florinda,
Mrs. Bowman. <i>Drury Lane; 22 April, 1708.</i> Willmore by Wilks;
Blunt, Estcourt; Frederick, Cibber; Hellena, Mrs. Oldfield; Angelica,
Mrs. Barry; Florinda, Mrs. Porter. <i>Drury Lane; 30 December, 1715.</i>
Willmore, Wilks; Blunt, Johnson; Hellena, Mrs. Mountfort; Angelica, Mrs.
Porter. <i>Drury Lane; 6&nbsp;March,
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
1716.</i> Don Pedro, Quin; Frederick, Ryan; Florinda, Mrs. Horton.
<i>Lincoln’s Inn Fields; 5&nbsp;April, 1725.</i> ‘Never acted there.’
Performed for Ryan’s benefit. Willmore, Ryan; Belvile, Quin; Blunt,
Spiller; Hellena, Mrs. Bullock; Angelica, Mrs. Parker. <i>Covent Garden;
9&nbsp;November, 1748.</i> Willmore, Ryan; Blunt, Bridgewater; Hellena,
Mrs. Woffington; Angelica, Mrs. Horton. To make this performance more
attractive there was also presented ‘a musical entertainment’, entitled,
<i>Apollo and Daphne</i>, which had been originally produced at
Lincoln’s Inn Fields in 1726. <i>Covent Garden; 19 February, 1757.</i>
‘Not acted twenty years.’ Willmore, Smith; Belvile, Ridout; Frederick,
Clarke; Don Antonio, Dyer; Blunt, Shuter; Hellena, Mrs. Woffington;
Angelica, Mrs. Hamilton; Florinda, Mrs. Elmy. This, the latest revival,
was performed with considerable expense, and proved successful, being
repeated no less than ten times during the season. Wilkinson says that
Shuter acted Blunt very realistically, and, as the stage directions of
Act&nbsp;iii require, stripped to his very drawers.</p>

<p>On 8 March, 1790, J. P. Kemble presented at Drury Lane a pudibond
alteration of <i>The Rover</i>, which he dubbed <i>Love in Many
Masks</i> (8vo, 1790). It was well received, and acted eight times; in
the following season once. Willmore was played by Kemble himself;
Belvile, Wroughton; Blunt, Jack Bannister; Stephano, Suett; Hellena,
Mrs. Jordan; Angelica, Mrs. Ward; Florinda, Mrs. Powell; Valeria, Mrs.
Kemble; Lucetta, Miss Tidswell. It is not entirely worthless from a
purely technical point of view, but yet very modest and mediocre. As
might well be surmised, the raciness and spirit of <i>The Rover</i>
entirely evaporate in the insipidity of emasculation. This is the last
recorded performance of Mrs. Behn’s brilliant comedy in any shape.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Hell.</span>
And dost thou think that ever I’ll be a Nun? Or at least till I’m so
old, I’m fit for nothing else. Faith no, Sister; and that which makes me
long to know whether you love <i>Belvile</i>, is because I hope he has
some mad Companion or other, that will spoil my Devotion; nay I’m

passable? a&nbsp;Vigour desirable? well shap’d? clean limb’d? sweet
breath’d? and Sense enough to know how all these ought to be employ’d to
the best Advantage: yes, I&nbsp;do and will. Therefore lay aside your
Hopes of my Fortune, by my being a Devotee, and tell me how you came
acquainted with this <i>Belvile</i>; for I perceive you knew him before
he came to <i>Naples</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Flor.</span>
Yes, I knew him at the <a class = "comm" name = "rover1_commtag5" id =

when the Town was ransack’d, nobly treated my Brother and my self,

a Slave of his Sister&mdash;And Sir, my Father’s Will, I’m sure, you may

<p><span class = "speaker">Pedro.</span>
I know not how dear I am to you, but I wish only to be rank’d in your

do you frown and blush? Is there any Guilt belongs to the Name of that
Cavalier?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Flor.</span>
I’ll not deny I value <i>Belvile</i>: when I was expos’d to such Dangers
as the licens’d Lust of common Soldiers threatned, when Rage and
Conquest flew thro the City&mdash;then <i>Belvile</i>, this Criminal for
my sake, threw himself into all Dangers to save my Honour, and will you
not allow him my Esteem?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Pedro.</span>
Yes, pay him what you will in Honour&mdash;but you must consider Don
<i>Vincentio’s</i> Fortune, and the Jointure he’ll make you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Flor.</span>
Let him consider my Youth, Beauty and Fortune; which ought not to be
thrown away on his Age and Jointure.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Pedro.</span>

THIS Play had been sooner in Print, but for a Report about the Town
(made by some either very Malitious or very Ignorant) that ’twas
<em>Thomaso</em> altered; which made the Book-sellers fear some trouble
from the Proprietor of that Admirable Play, which indeed has Wit enough
to stock a Poet, and is not to be piec’t or mended by any but the
Excellent Author himself; That I have stol’n some hints from it may be a
proof, that I valu’d it more than to pretend to alter it: had I had the
Dexterity of some Poets who are not more expert in stealing than in the
Art of Concealing, and who even that way out-do the

<i>Rabel’s Drops.</i> Monsieur Rabell, as he is sometimes termed, was a
famous empiric of the day. A&nbsp;description of his medicaments may be
found in ‘<i>Pharmacopoeia Bateana</i>; or, Bate’s Dispensatory. Edited
by William Salmon, London, 1700.’ Rabell’s name occurs on the title-page
of this book, and in Section VI of the Preface Rabell’s ‘Styptick Drops’
are alluded to as having been added to the recipes found in the original
volume by G. Bate. An account of the manufacture and use of this
particular remedy appears in the same volume, Lib.&nbsp;I, chap.&nbsp;x,
under ‘Sal Stypticum Rabelli’. Salmon, who edited this pharmacopoeia,
was himself an irregular practitioner of some notoriety. He took part in
the great controversy with the doctors which raged about 1698 and
earlier. He finds a sorry place in Garth’s <i>Dispensary</i>, canto III,
l.&nbsp;6, wherein his works are alluded to as ‘blessed opiates’.</p>

<i>Cits in May-day Coaches.</i> On May-day it was the custom for all
sorts and conditions of persons and pleasure parties to visit Hyde Park
in coaches or at least on horse-back, cf. Pepys <i>Diary</i>,
1&nbsp;May, 1663: ‘We all took horse, and I ... rode, with some trouble,
through the fields, and then Holborn, etc., towards Hyde Park, whither
all the world, I&nbsp;think, are going; ... there being people of all
sorts in coaches there, to some thousands.... By and by ... I&nbsp;rode
home, coaches going in great crowds to the further end of the town
almost.’</p>

<i>Sancho, Pimp to Lucetta. Mr. John Lee.</i> There were at this time
two actors and two actresses of the name Lee, Leigh, who, especially in
view of the eclectic spelling of seventeenth-century proper names, need
to be carefully distinguished. John Lee, who appeared in the small rôle
of Sancho and also took the equally unimportant part of Sebastian in
<i>Abdelazer</i> this same year, had, according to Downes, joined the
Duke’s Company about 1670. He never rose above an entirely insignificant
line, and we find him cast as Alexas in Pordage’s <i>Herod and
Mariamne</i>, 1673; Titiro in Settle’s <i>Pastor Fido</i>, 1676; Pedro
in Porter’s <i>The French Conjurer</i>, and Noddy in <i>The Counterfeit
Bridegroom</i>, 1677. He was, it is almost certain, the husband of the
famous Mrs. Mary Lee. Downes’ entry runs as follows: ‘<i>Note</i>, About
the year 1670, Mrs. <i>Aldridge</i>, after Mrs. <i>Lee</i>, after Lady
<i>Slingsby</i>, also Mrs. <i>Leigh</i> Wife, Mr. <i>John Lee</i>, Mr.
<i>Crosby</i>, Mrs. <i>Johnson</i>, were entertain’d in the Dukes
House.’ There is of course some confusion here. Antony Leigh, it may be
noted, is not mentioned in the <i>Roscius Anglicanus</i> for another
three years to come (1673), and there can be little doubt that the above
passage should read ‘also Mrs. Leigh’s [Lee’s] husband, Mr John Lee’. If
this were not so, there would be no point in Downes
<span class = "pagenum notes">439</span>
mentioning so minor an actor at this juncture and in such a list. Crosby
and Mrs. Johnson were both performers of great merit, in fact Downes,
a&nbsp;page later, has a special warm word of praise for the lady whom
we find cast as Carolina in Shadwell’s <i>Epsom Wells</i> (1672). Crosby
played such parts as Mr. Cleverwit, Lucia’s lover, in Ravenscroft’s
<i>Mamamouchi</i> (1672), Alonzo in <i>Abdelazer</i> (1677), Leander
Fancy in <i>Sir Patient Fancy</i> (1678). John Lee disappears entirely
after 1677, and his widow is first billed as Lady Slingsby in 1681. For
a full account of this great tragedienne see note on <i>Abdelazer</i>,
Vol.&nbsp;II.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Leigh, Moretta in <i>The Rover</i>, Part I, who is so
persistently confused with Mrs. Mary Lee, was the wife of Antony Leigh,
the celebrated comedian. In Betterton’s comedy, <i>The Revenge</i>
(1680), when she acted Mrs. Dashit, she is billed as Mrs. A.&nbsp;Lee.
Her husband died in December, 1692. Their son Michael also gave great
promise on the boards. The lad’s name occurs in the cast of Shadwell’s
<i>The Amorous Bigot</i> (1690) as ‘young Leigh’, when he played Diego,
a&nbsp;servant, to his father’s Tegue o’ Divelly, the Irish friar.
Unfortunately he died at an early age, probably in the winter of 1701,
but his younger brother Francis attained considerable success. Frank
Leigh made his debut at Lincoln’s Inn’s Fields, 31 December, 1702, as
Tristram in the original production of Mrs. Centlivre’s <i>The Stolen
Heiress.</i> He died in the autumn of 1719. Mrs. Leigh was herself an
actress of no small eminence, her special line being ‘affected mothers,
aunts, and modest stale maids that had missed their market’. Says
Cibber, ‘In all these, with many others, she was extremely
entertaining’. After 10 June, 1707, when she acted Lady Sly in Carlile’s
<i>The Fortune Hunters</i>, her name is no longer to be found in the
bills, and in October, 1707, Mrs. Powell is playing her parts. Mrs.
Leigh’s repertory was very large, and amongst her roles were Lady
Woodvil in Etheredge’s <i>The Man of Mode</i> (1676); Lady Plyant in
<i>The Double Dealer</i> (1694); the Nurse in <i>Love for Love</i>
(1695); the Hostess in Betterton’s revival of <i>Henry&nbsp;IV</i>,
Part&nbsp;I (1699); and Lady Wishfort in <i>The Way of the World</i>
(1700). In comedies by Mrs. Behn, Mrs. Leigh only appears twice,
Moretta, <i>The Rover</i>, Part&nbsp;I (1677); and Mrs. Closet, <i>The
City Heiress</i> (1682).</p>

<p>In and about 1702 another Mrs. Leigh, perhaps Frank Leigh’s wife,
made a brief appearance. She was at first cast for good parts but soon
sank into obscurity. Thus on 21 October, 1702, she sustained Mrs.
Plotwell in Mrs. Centlivre’s <i>The Beau’s Duel</i>; on 28 April, 1703,
Chloris in the Hon. Charles Boyle’s insipid <i>As You Find It.</i> She
may have been the Mrs. Eli. Leigh who with other performers signed a
petition to Queen Anne in 1709. Of Mrs. Rachel Lee, who took the
‘walk-on’ part of Judy, a&nbsp;waiting-woman, in Southern’s <i>The
Maid’s Last Prayer</i> (1693), nothing is known.</p>

<i>Angelica Bianca, a&nbsp;famous Curtezan. Mrs. Gwin.</i> Anne Quin
(or&nbsp;Quyn, Gwin, Gwyn as the name is indifferently spelt) was a
famous actress of great personal beauty. She is constantly, but most
erroneously, confounded with Nell Gwynne, and the mistake is the more
unpardonable as both names twice occur in the same cast. When Nelly was
<span class = "pagenum notes">440</span>
acting Florimel in Dryden’s <i>Secret Love</i>, produced February, 1667,
Mrs. Quin played Candiope. Again, in <i>An Evening’s Love</i>, June,
1668, Nell Gwynne was Jacinta, and Mrs Quin Aurelia, a&nbsp;role assumed
later in the run by Mrs. Marshall. Among Mrs. Quin’s more notable parts
were Alizia (Alice Perrers) in Orrery’s <i>The Black Prince</i>,
produced 19 October, 1667; 1677, Thalestris in Pordage’s <i>The Siege of
Babylon</i>, and Astrea in <i>The Constant Nymph</i>; 1678, Lady Knowell
in <i>Sir Patient Fancy</i> and Lady Squeamish in Otway’s <i>Friendship
in Fashion</i>; 1682, Queen Elizabeth in Banks’ <i>The Unhappy
Favourite</i>, and Sunamire in Southerne’s <i>The Loyal Brother.</i>
Mrs. Quin appears to have retired from the stage towards the close of
the year 1682. There exists of this actress an extremely interesting
portrait which was offered for sale at Stevens’ Auction Rooms, 26
February, 1901, but not reaching the reserve price, withdrawn. It is
mistakenly described in the catalogue as ‘Miniature Portrait of Nell
Gwynn on copper with original case and 30 cover dresses on talc...’ An
illustrated article on it, entitled, ‘Nell Gwynne’s Various Guises’,
appeared in the <i>Lady’s Pictorial</i>, 23 March, of the same year,
p.&nbsp;470, in the course of which the writer says: ‘Accompanying the
miniature are some thirty mica covers in different stages of
preservation upon which various headdresses and costumes are painted.
The place where, in the ordinary course, the face would come is in all
cases left blank, the talc being of course transparent, when it is laid
upon the original miniature the countenance of the latter becomes
visible, and we are enabled to see Nell Gwynne [Anne Quin] as she would
appear in various characters.’ The old error has been perpetuated here,
but the <i>Lady’s Pictorial</i> reproduced half-a-dozen of these painted
mica covers, and the costumes for the two roles of Queen Elizabeth and
Sunamire can be distinctly recognized. Doubtless an examination of the
original micas would soon yield an identification of other characters.
The miniature, it may be noted, does not in the least resemble Nell
Gwynne, so there is bare excuse here for the confusion.</p>

<i>Balcony... each side of the Door.</i> With regard to the proscenium
doors and balconies of a Restoration theatre, our knowledge of these
points has been rendered much more exact since the valuable discovery by
that well-known authority in stage matters, Mr. W.&nbsp;J. Lawrence, of
Sir Christopher Wren’s designs for the second Theatre Royal, Drury Lane,
1674. Beyond the proscenium on the apron there are four doors each with
its balcony above. The height of these balconies from the stage is
considerable, surprisingly so indeed in view of the fact that characters
frequently have to climb up into or descend from one of these ‘windows’,
e.g., Shadwell’s <i>The Miser</i> (1672), Act.&nbsp;iv, when the drunken
bullies ‘bounce at the Doors’, we have ‘Squeeze at the Window in his
Cap, and undressed,’ who cries: ‘I&nbsp;must venture to escape at this
Window’; ‘he leaps down’, and yells, as he falls, ‘Death! I&nbsp;have
broke my Bones; oh! oh!’ whilst the scowrers run up, exclaiming:
‘Somebody leaped out of a Window’, and he is promptly seized. In
Ravenscroft’s <i>The London Cuckolds</i> (1682), Act.&nbsp;v: ‘Enter
Ramble above in the Balcony’. This gallant, escaping from the house
hurriedly, decides ‘which way shall I get down? I&nbsp;must venture to
hang by my hands and then drop from the Balcony’. Next: ‘As Ramble is
getting down Doodle enters to look for his glove, Ramble drops upon him
and beats him down.’ This could hardly have been an easy bit of stage
business, although Smith, who acted Ramble, was an athletic, tall young
fellow.</p>

<p>Normally no doubt only two of the doors (those nearest the proscenium
opening on opposite sides) with their balconies were in constant use by
the actors as the exigencies of the play might demand, but if required,
all four balconies, and more frequently, all four doors could be and
were employed. It is noticeable in Wren’s design that the balconies are
not stage balconies, but side boxes, a&nbsp;permanent part of the
general architectural scheme, and there can be no doubt that, save in
exceptional circumstances, the two outermost were occupied by
spectators. If the play did not require the use of a balcony at all,
spectators would also fill the inner side boxes. In time, indeed, two
doors and two balconies only came to be used, but for some decades at
least all four were practicable. The present passage of <i>The Rover</i>
indicates the use of three doors. The bravos hang up two little pictures
of Angelica, one at each side of the door of her house, and presently
the fair courtezan appears in her balcony above. A&nbsp;little later Don
Pedro and Stephano enter by one door at the opposite side, Don Antonio
and his page by the second door on the same side as Pedro.</p>

<p>In Etheredge’s <i>She Wou’d if She Cou’d</i> (6&nbsp;February, 1668)
Act ii,&nbsp;1, Courtal and Freeman are seen following up Ariana and
Gatty in the Mulberry Garden. Presently ‘The Women go out, and go about
behind the Scenes to the other Door’, then ‘Enter the Women [at one
door] and after ’em Courtal at the lower Door, and Freeman at the upper
on the contrary side’.</p>

<p>Three balconies are employed in Ravenscroft’s <i>Mamamouchi</i>
(1672; 4to 1675) Act iv. We have ‘Enter Mr. Jorden, musick’ obviously in
one balcony from the ensuing dialogue. Then ‘Cleverwit, in Turk’s
<span class = "pagenum notes">442</span>
habit, with Betty Trickmore and Lucia appear in the Balcony’ number two.
A&nbsp;song is sung and ‘Young Jorden and Marina in the Balcony against
’em’. Young Jorden remarks, ‘Now, dearest Marina, let us ascend to your
Father, he is by this time from his Window convinc’d of the slight is
put on you....’ ‘They retire’ and although there has been no exit marked
for Mr, Jorden, we find directly, ‘Enter Mr. Jorden and Trickmore,’
obviously upon the stage itself, to which Mr. Jorden has descended. It
must be noted, however, that the use of more than two balconies is very
rare.</p>

<p>Mr. W. J. Lawrence in <i>The Elizabethan Playhouse and other
Studies</i> (First Series) aptly writes: ‘No dramatist of the time had a
better sense of the theatre than Mrs. Behn, and none made more adroit
employment of the balconies.’ He then cites the scene of Angelica, her
bravos and admirers.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span>
exiled cavaliers, Willmore the Rover, Shift and Hunt, two officers, Ned
Blunt and Fetherfool, his friend, have arrived at Madrid, where they are
welcomed by Beaumond, nephew to the English Ambassador. Both Willmore
and Beaumond are enamoured of La Nuche, a&nbsp;beautiful courtezan,
whilst Shift and Hunt are respectively courting a Giantess and a Dwarf,
two Mexican Jewesses of immense wealth, newly come to Madrid with an old
Hebrew, their uncle and guardian. Beaumond is contracted to Ariadne, who
loves Willmore. Whilst the Rover is complimenting La Nuche, some
Spaniards, headed by Don Carlo, an aged admirer of the lady, attempt to
separate the pair. During the scuffle the ladies enter a church, where
they are followed by the gallants. A&nbsp;little later Fetherfool comes
to terms with La Nuche’s duenna, Petronella, whilst Willmore makes love
to Ariadne. Shift next informs Willmore of the arrival of a celebrated
mountebank, and the Rover resolves to take the quack’s place, which he
does in effective disguise. Fetherfool and Blunt visit the
pseudo-doctor’s house, where the Giantess and Dwarf are lodged to be
converted to a reasonable size by his medicaments; covetous of their
great fortunes, the coxcombs also begin to court the two Jewesses. La
Nuche comes to consult the mountebank and meets Ariadne attired as a
boy, and Willmore in his own dress. Ariadne, who has a rendezvous that
evening with Willmore, is accidentally anticipated by La Nuche, who runs
into the garden during a night brawl between Beaumond and the Rover,
each of whom is ignorant of his opponent’s personality. Both the
combatants encounter the courtezan in the garden and are joined by
Ariadne. The confusion and mistakes that ensue are augmented by the
arrival of Beaumond’s page and eventually all disperse in different
directions. La Nuche returns to her house, where Fetherfool&mdash;led on
by the Duenna&mdash;awaits her. Carlo, however, come thither for the
same purpose, enters the chambers, and after they have fallen to
fisticuffs, Fetherfool in a fright escapes through a window. Meanwhile
La Nuche is engaged with Willmore; Beaumond interrupts, and both leave
her in pretended disdain. Ariadne, purposing to meet the Rover, mistakes
Beaumond for him in the dark and they hurry away to the quack’s house.
Here, however, Fetherfool has already arrived and, finding the Giantess
asleep, robs her of a pearl necklace; but he is alarmed by Shift, who
takes her off and promptly weds her, whilst Hunt does the same by the
Dwarf. Blunt next appears leading Petronella, veiled, who, filching a
casket of jewels, has just fled from La Nuche; but the hag is discovered
and compelled to disgorge. The Jewish Guardian is reconciled to the
marriages of his wards; Beaumond and Ariadne, Willmore and La Nuche
arrive, and the various mistakes with regard to identity are rectified,
Willmore incidentally revealing himself as the sham mountebank. Beaumond
and Ariadne agree to marry, whilst La Nuche gives herself to the
Rover.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Induced</span>
by the extraordinary success of <i>The Rover</i> in 1677, Mrs. Behn,
four years later, turned again to Killigrew’s <i>Thomaso; or, The
Wanderer</i>, and produced a sequel to her play. She had, however,
already made good use of the best points of the old comedy, and the
remaining material only being that which her judgment first rejected, it
is not a matter of surprise to find the second part of <i>The Rover</i>
somewhat inferior to the first. This is by no means to say that it is
not an amusing comedy full of bustle and humour. The intrigue of
Willmore and La Nuche, together with the jocantries of the inimitable
Blunt, Nick Fetherfool, and the antique Petronella Elenora, are all
alive with the genius of Astrea, although it may be possibly objected
that some of the episodes with the two Monsters and the pranks of
Harlequin are apt to trench a little too nearly on the realm of
farce.</p>




<h4><a name = "rover2_hist">THEATRICAL HISTORY.</a></h4>


<p><i>The Second Part of The Rover</i> was produced at the Duke’s
Theatre, Dorset Gardens, in 1681. It is noticeable that Will Smith had
so distinguished himself in Willmore, that Betterton, who appeared as
Belvile in the first part, did not essay a character in the second. The
cast was reinforced, however, by Mrs. Barry, who took the role of La
Nuche.</p>

<p>The play was received with great applause; it suffered none the less
the fate of most sequels and, being overshadowed by its predecessor,
after a few decades disappeared from the boards.</p>

<p>Great Sir,</p>

<p>I dread to appear in this Humble Dedication to Your Royal Highness,
as one of those Insolent and Saucy Offenders who take occasion by Your
absence to commit ill-mannered indecencies, unpardonable to a Prince of
your Illustrious Birth and God-like Goodness, but that in spight of
Seditious Scandal You can forgive; and all the World knows You can
suffer with a Divine Patience: the proofs You have early and late given
of this, have been such, as if Heaven design’d ’em only to give the
World an undeniable Testimony of Your Noble Vertues, Your Loyalty and
True Obedience (if&nbsp;I may presume to say&nbsp;so,) both to Your
Sacred Brother, and the never satisfied People, when either one
Commanded, or t’other repin’d, With how chearful and intire a submission
You Obey’d? And tho the Royal Son of a Glorious Father who was render’d
unfortunate by the unexemplary ingratitude of his worst of Subjects; and
sacrific’d to the insatiate and cruel Villany of a seeming sanctifi’d
Faction, who cou’d never hope to expiate for the unparallell’d sin, but
by an intire submission to the Gracious Off-spring of this Royal Martyr:
yet You, Great Sir, denying Yourself the Rights and Priviledges the
meanest Subject Claims, with a Fortitude worthy Your Adorable Vertues,
put Yourself upon a voluntary Exile to appease the causeless murmurs of
this again gathering Faction, who make their needless and self-created
fears, an occasion to Play the old Game o’re again; whil’st the Politick
self-interested and malitious few betray the unconsidering Rest, with
the delicious sounds of Liberty and Publick Good; that lucky Cant which
so few years since so miserably reduc’d all the Noble, Brave and Honest,
to the Obedience of the ill-gotten Power, and worse-acted Greatness of
the Rabble; so that whil’st they most unjustly cry’d down the oppression
of one of the best of Monarchs, and all Kingly Government: all England
found itself deplorably inslav’d by the Arbitrary <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘Tryanny’">Tyranny</ins> of many
Pageant Kings. Oh that we shou’d so far forget with what greatness of
mind You then shar’d the common Fate, as now and again to force Your
Royal Person to new Perils, and new Exiles; but such ingratitude we are
punisht with, and You still suffer for, and still forgive&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>This more than Human Goodness, with the incouragement Your Royal
Highness was pleas’d to give the Rover at his first appearance, and the
concern You were pleas’d to have for his second, makes me presume to lay
him at Your feet; he is a wanderer too, distrest; belov’d, the
unfortunate,
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
and ever conscent to Loyalty; were he Legions he should follow and
suffer still with so Excellent a Prince and Master. Your Infant worth he

which taught even Your Enemies so intire an Obedience, that asham’d of
their Rebel Gallantry, they have resign’d their guilty Commissions, and
Vow’d never to Draw Sword more but in the Royal Cause; which Vow
Religiously they kept: a&nbsp;noble Example for the busie and hot
Mutineers of this Age misled by Youth, false Ambition and falser
Council.</p>

<p>How careless since Your Glorious Restauration You have been, of Your
Life for the service of Your mistaken Country, the whole World knows,
and all brave men admire.</p>

<p>Pardon me then, Great Sir, if I presume to present my faithful
Soldier, (which no Storms of Fate can ever draw from his Obedience) to
so great a General: allow him, Royal Sir, a&nbsp;shelter and protection,
who was driven from his Native Country with You, forc’d as You were, to
fight for his Bread in a Strange Land, and suffer’d with You all the
Ills of Poverty, War and Banishment; and still pursues Your Fortunes;
and though he cannot serve Your Highness, he may possibly have the
Honour of diverting You a few moments: which tho Your Highness cannot
want in a place where all Hearts and Knees are justly bow’d in
Adoration, where all conspire, as all the Earth (who have the blessing
of Your presence) ought to entertain, serve and please You; yet this
humble Tribute of a most Zealous and Devout Heart, may find amongst Your
busier hours of greater moment, some one wherein it may have the Glory
of Your regard, and be capable in some small degree of unbending Your
great mind from Royal Cares, the weightiest Cares of all; which if it be
so fortunate as to do, I&nbsp;have my end, and the Glory I design,
a&nbsp;sufficient reward for her who does and will eternally pray for

to James’ withdrawal from England in 1679, at the time of the seditious
agitation to pass an illegal Exclusion Bill. The Duke left on
4&nbsp;March for Amsterdam, afterwards residing at the Hague. In August
he came back, Charles being very ill. Upon the King’s recovery he
retired to Scotland 27 October. In March, 1682, he paid a brief visit to
the King, finally returning home June of the same year.</p>

<i>City Pope.</i> An allusion to the exploits of Elkanah Settle, who was
so notorious at that time for violent Whiggism that in 1680 he had
presided over the senseless city ceremony of ‘Pope-burning’ on 17
November. This annual piece of ridiculous pageantry is smartly described
by Dryden in his Prologue to Southerne’s <i>The Loyal Brother</i>
(1682); and in the Epilogue to <i>Oedipus</i>, (1679), after enumerating
the attractions of the play, he ends&mdash; </p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>We know not what you can desire or hope</p>
<p>To please you more, but burning of a Pope.</p>
</div>

<p>There are many contemporary references to Settle and his ‘fireworks’.
Otway, in <i>The Poet’s Complaint</i> (4to, 1680), speaks of Rebellion
cockering the silly rabble with ‘November squibs and burning pasteboard
Popes’, canto xi. Duke, in the Epilogue to the same author’s <i>The
Atheist</i> (1683), says that the poet never ‘made one rocket on Queen
Bess’s night’. In Scott’s <i>Dryden</i>, Vol. VI (1808) is given a cut
representing the tom-fool procession of 1679, in which an effigy of the
murdered Sir Edmund Bury Godfrey had a chief place. There were
‘ingenious fireworks’ and a bonfire. A&nbsp;scurrilous broadside of the
day, with regard to the shouting, says that ‘’twas believed the echo ...
reached Scotland [the Duke was then residing in the North], France, and
even Rome itself damping them all with a dreadfull astonishment.’ The
stage at this juncture of fierce political strife had become a veritable
battle-ground of parties, and some stir was caused by Settle’s blatant,
but not ineffective, melodrama on the subject of that mythical dame
<i>The Female Prelate, being the History of the Life and Death of Pope
Joan</i>, produced at the Theatre Royal, 1680. This play itself is often
referred to, and there are other allusions to Pope Joan about this time,
e.g., in the Epilogue to Lee’s <i>Cæsar Borgia</i> (1679), where the
author says a certain clique could not have been more resolute to damn
his play</p>

<div class = "verse">

<i>Harlequin, Willmore’s Man.</i> Although no actor’s name is printed
for Harlequin, the part was undoubtedly played by Shadwell’s
brother-in-law, Tom Jevon, who, at the age of twenty-one, had joined the
company in 1673. Originally a dancing-master (Langbaine notes his
‘activity’), he became famous in low comedy and particularly for his
lithe and nimble Harlequins. In Otway’s <i>Friendship in Fashion</i>
(1677) Malagene, a&nbsp;character written for and created by Jevon,
says, ‘I’m a very good mimick; I&nbsp;can act Punchinello, Scaramuchio,
Harlequin, Prince Prettyman, or any thing.’</p>

<p>Harlequin does not appear in Killigrew’s <i>Thomaso.</i> Mrs. Behn’s
mime plays pranks and speaks Italian and Spanish. No doubt she derived
the character from the Italian comedians who had been at the Royal
Theatre, Whitehall, in 1672-3, as Dryden, in an Epilogue (spoken by
Hart) to <i>The Silent Woman</i> when acted at Oxford, after a reference
to a visit of French comedians, has:&mdash; </p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>The Italian Merry-Andrews took their place,</p>
<p>And quite debauched the stage with lewd grimace,</p>
<p>Instead of wit and humours, your delight</p>
<p>Was there to see two hobby-horses fight,</p>
<p>Stout Scaramoucha with rush lance rode in,</p>
<p>And ran a tilt at centaur Arlequin.</p>
</div>

<p>They were acting again in July, 1675, and remained some months in
England. cf. Evelyn, 29 September this same year, writes: ‘I&nbsp;saw
the Italian Scaramuccio act before the King at Whitehall, people giving
money to come in, which was very scandalous and never so before at
Court-diversions. Having seen him act before in Italy many years past,
I&nbsp;was not averse from seeing the most excellent of that kind of
folly.’ Duffett in his Prologue to <i>Ev’ry Man out of his Humour</i>,
‘spoken by Mr. Hayns’, July, 1675, who refers to this second
visit&mdash; </p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>The Modish Nymphs now ev’ry heart will win</p>
<p>With the surprizing ways of Harlequin</p>
<span class = "pagenum notes">445</span>
<p>O the fine motion and the jaunty mene</p>
<p>While you Gallants&mdash; </p>
<p>Who for dear Missie ne’er can do too much</p>

<p>and a little later he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Religion has its Scarramouchys too</p>
<p>Whose hums and has get all the praise and pence.</p>
</div>

<p>This Italian troop evidently returned in the following year or in
1677, as we have allusions to Dominique Biancolelli and Fiurelli, ‘the
Fam’d Harlequin &amp; Scaramouch’, in the Prologue to Ravenscroft’s
<i>Scaramouch a Philosopher, Harlequin a School-Boy, Bravo, Merchant,
and Magician</i>, a&nbsp;Comedy after the Italian Manner, produced at
the Theatre Royal in 1677, with the migratory Joe Haines as Harlequin,
and again in <i>Friendship in Fashion</i>, Act iii,&nbsp;1, when Lady
Squeamish cries: ‘Dear Mr. Malagene, won’t you let us see you act a
little something of Harlequin? I’ll swear you do it so naturally, it
makes me think I am at the Louvre or Whitehall all the time.’ [Malagene
acts.]</p>

<i>Lucia... Mrs. Norris.</i> In the quarto the name of this actress is
spelled Norice. Even if the two characters Lucia and Petronella Elenora
were not so entirely different, one being a girl, the second a withered
crone, it is obvious that as both appear on the stage at one and the
same time Mrs. Norris could not have doubled these rôles. The name Mrs.
Norice, however, which is cast for Lucia is undoubtedly a misprint for
Mrs. Price. This lady may possibly have been the daughter of Joseph
Price, an ‘Inimitable sprightly Actor’, who was dead in 1673. We find
Mrs. Price cast for various rôles of no great consequence, similar to
Lucia in this play. She sustained Camilla in Otway’s <i>Friendship in
Fashion</i> (1678), Violante in Leanerd’s <i>The Counterfeits</i>
(1679), Sylvia in <i>The Soldier’s Fortune</i> (1683), Hippolita in
D’Urfey’s <i>A Commonwealth of Women</i> (1685), and many more, all of
which belong to the ‘second walking-lady’.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norris, who acted Petronella Elenora, was a far more important
figure in the theatre. One of those useful and, indeed, indispensable
performers, who, without ever attaining any prominent position,
contribute more essentially than is often realized to the success of a
play, she became well known for her capital personations of old women
and dowagers. Wife of the actor Norris, she had been one of the earliest
members of Davenant’s company, and her son, known as Jubilee Dicky from
his superlative performance in Farquhar’s <i>The Constant Couple</i>
(1699), was a leading comedian in the reigns of Anne and the first
George. Amongst Mrs. Norris’ many rôles such parts as Lady Dupe, the old
lady in Dryden’s <i>Sir Martin Mar-All</i> (1667), Goody Rash in
Crowne’s <i>The Country Wit</i> (1675), Nuarcha, an amorous old maid, in
Maidwell’s <i>The Loving Enemies</i> (1680), Mother Dunwell, the bawd in
Betterton’s <i>The Revenge; or, A&nbsp;Match in Newgate</i> (1680), all
sufficiently typify her special line, within whose limits she won
considerable applause.</p>

<i>the Royal Sovereign.</i> In a Navy List of 1684 the <i>Royal
Sovereign</i> is classed as one of the ‘Nine First Rate’ vessels. 1545
tons, 100 guns at home, 90 guns abroad, 815 men at home, 710 men abroad.
In 1672 her commander was Sir Joseph Jorden. An authority on nautical
matters whom I have consulted informs me that less men and fewer guns
were carried to relieve the top hamper of the ship in a sea-way. Most
vessels then were inclined to be top heavy, and although able to carry
all their guns in the narrow seas, yet when going foreign were glad to
leave ten behind, well knowing they would soon lose by scurvy or disease
numbers of their crew apart from losses in battle. Although these ships
were pierced with ports for, say, 100 guns, it did not follow they
always carried so many, as a complete broadside could be fired by
running the gun carriages across from one side to another before the
fight, so she would not be so heavy above and not so liable to roll and
spoil the aim of the guns.</p>

<i>Plymouth Cloaks.</i> Obsolete slang for a cudgel ‘carried by one who
walked <i>en cuerpo</i>, and thus facetiously assumed to take the place
of a cloak’. Fuller (1661), <i>Worthies</i>, ‘Devon’ (1662), 248,
‘A&nbsp;Plimouth Cloak. That is a Cane or a Staffe whereof this the
occasion. Many a man of good Extraction comming home from far Voiages,
may chance to land here [at Plymouth] and being out of sorts, is unable
for the present time and place to recruit himself with Cloaths. Here
(if&nbsp;not friendly provided) they make the next Wood their Draper’s
shop, where a Staffe cut out, serves them for a covering’. Ray,
<i>Prov.</i> (1670), 225, adds, ‘For we use when we walk <i>in
cuerpo</i> to carry a staff in our hands but none when in a cloak’.
<i>N.E.D.</i>, which also quotes this passage of <i>The Rover.</i> cf.
Davenant:&mdash; </p>

<i>Guzman Medicines.</i> Trashy, worthless medicines. In <i>The Emperor
of The Moon</i>, Act iii,&nbsp;2, ‘Guzman’ is used as a term of abuse to
signify a rascal. The first English translation (by&nbsp;James Mabbe) of
Aleman’s famous romance, <i>Vida del Picaro Guzman d’Alfarache</i>, is,
indeed, entitled <i>The Rogue</i>, and it had as running title <i>The
Spanish Rogue.</i> There is a novel by George Fidge entitled <i>The
English Gusman; or, the History of that Unparallel’d Thief James
Hind.</i> (1652, 4to.)</p>

<i>Copper Chains.</i> In allusion to the trick played by Estifania on

gems, and when later he scents the cozenage, he bawls out:&mdash; </p>

<i>by Play-Bill, summon’d here.</i> In Restoration times one method of
announcing the next day’s performance to the public was by putting out
bills on posts in the streets adjacent to the theatre. There are
allusions to this in Pepys, 24 March, 1662 and 28 July, 1664. The whole
subject has been exhaustively treated by Mr. W.&nbsp;J. Lawrence in ‘The
Origin of the Theatre Programme’&mdash; <i>The Elizabethan Playhouse</i>
(Second Series).</p>

<i>greasing.</i> Flattery. Settle’s post as City Poet, it is well known,
did not bring him in any great emoluments. He was, in fact, desperately
poor, and even volunteered to join King James’ army at Hounslow Heath.
In old age he was reduced to writing drolls performed in a

Bartholomew Fair booth kept by one Mrs. Minns and her daughter, Mrs.
Leigh. He himself acted in these wretched farces, and on one occasion,
in <i>St. George for England</i>, appeared as a dragon in a green
leather case. Eventually he obtained admission to the Charterhouse,
where he died 24 February, 1724.</p>

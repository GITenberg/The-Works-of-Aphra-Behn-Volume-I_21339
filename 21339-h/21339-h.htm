<p><span class = "firstword">It</span> is perhaps not altogether easy to
appreciate the multiplicity of difficulties with which the first editor
of Mrs. Behn has to cope. Not only is her life strangely mysterious and
obscure, but the rubbish of half-a-dozen romancing biographers must
needs be cleared away before we can even begin to see daylight. Matter
which had been for two centuries accepted on seemingly the soundest
authority is proven false; her family name itself was, until my recent
discovery, wrongly given; the very question of her portrait has its own
vexed (and until now unrecognized) dilemmas. In fine there seems no
point connected with our first professional authoress which did not call
for the nicest investigation and the most incontrovertible proof before
it could be accepted without suspicion or reserve. The various
collections of her plays and novels which appeared in the first half of
the eighteenth century give us nothing; nay, they rather cumber our path
with the trash of discredited <i>Memoirs</i>. Pearson’s reprint (1871)
is entirely valueless: there is no attempt, however meagre, at editing,
no effort to elucidate a single allusion; moreover, several of the
Novels&mdash;and the Poems in their entirety&mdash;are lacking.
I&nbsp;am happy to give (Vol.&nbsp;V) one of the Novels, and that not
the least important, <i>The History of the Nun</i>, for the first time
in any collected edition. Poems, in addition
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
to those which appeared in Mrs. Behn’s lifetime, and were never
reprinted after, have been gathered with great care from many sources
(of&nbsp;which some were almost forgotten).</p>

<p>It is hoped that this new issue of Mrs. Behn may prove adequate. Any
difficulties in the editing have been more than amply compensated for by
the interest shown by many friends. Foremost, my best thanks are due to
Mr. Bullen, whose life-long experience of the minutiæ of editing our
best dramatic literature, has been ungrudgingly at my service
throughout, to the no small advantage of myself and my work. Mr. Edmund
Gosse, C.B., has shown the liveliest interest in the book from its
inception, and I owe him most grateful recognition for his kindly
encouragement and aid. Nay, more, he did not spare to lend me treasured
items from his library so rich in first, and boasting unique, editions
of Mrs. Behn. Mr. G.&nbsp;Thorn Drury, K.C., never wearied of answering
my enquiries, and in discussion solved many a knotty point. To him I am
obliged for the transcript of Mrs. Behn’s letter to Waller’s
daughter-in-law, and also the Satire on Dryden. He even gave of his
valuable time to read through the Memoir and from the superabundance of
his knowledge made suggestions of the first importance. The unsurpassed
library of Mr. T.&nbsp;J. Wise, the well-known bibliographer, was freely
at my disposal. In other cases where I have received any assistance in
clearing a difficulty I have made my acknowledgement in the note
itself.</p>

<h4><a name = "intro">MEMOIR OF MRS. BEHN.</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> personal history of Aphra Behn,
the first Englishwoman to earn her livelihood by authorship, is
unusually interesting but very difficult to unravel and relate. In
dealing with her biography writers at different periods have rushed
headlong to extremes, and we now find that the pendulum has swung to its
fullest stretch. On the one hand, we have prefixed to a collection of
the <i>Histories and Novels</i>, published in 1696, ‘The Life of Mrs.
Behn written by one of the Fair Sex’, a&nbsp;frequently reprinted (and
even expanded) compilation crowded with romantic incidents that savour
all too strongly of the Italian novella, with sentimental epistolography
and details which can but be accepted cautiously and in part. On the
other there have recently appeared two revolutionary essays by Dr.
Ernest Bernbaum of Harvard, ‘Mrs. Behn’s <i>Oroonoko</i>’, first printed
in <i>Kittredge Anniversary Papers</i>, 1913; and&mdash;what is even
more particularly pertinent&mdash;’Mrs. Behn’s Biography a Fiction,’
<i>Publications of the Modern Language Association of America</i>,
xxviii,&nbsp;3: both afterwards issued as separate pamphlets, 1913. In
these, the keen critical sense of the writer has apparently been so
jarred by the patent incongruities, the baseless fiction, nay, the very
fantasies (such as the fairy pavilion seen floating upon the Channel),
which, imaginative and invented flotsam that they are, accumulated and
were heaped
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
about the memory of Aphra Behn, that he is apt to regard almost every
record outside those of her residence at Antwerp<a class = "tag" name =
"tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> with a suspicion which is in
many cases surely unwarranted and undue. Having energetically cleared
away the more peccant rubbish, Dr. Bernbaum became, it appears to us,
a&nbsp;little too drastic, and had he then discriminated rather than
swept clean, we were better able wholly to follow the conclusions at
which he arrives. He even says that after ‘1671’<a class = "tag" name =
"tag2" id = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a> when ‘she began to write for
the stage ... such meagre contemporary notices as we find of her are
critical rather than biographical’. This is a very partial truth; from
extant letters,<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href =
"#note3">3</a> to which Dr. Bernbaum does not refer, we can gather much
of Mrs. Behn’s literary life and circumstances. She was a figure of some
note, and even if we had no other evidence it seems impossible that her
contemporaries should have glibly accepted the fiction of a voyage to
Surinam and a Dutch husband named Behn who had never existed.</p>

<p>Ayfara, or Aphara<a class = "tag" name = "tag4" id = "tag4" href =
"#note4">4</a> (Aphra), Amis or Amies, the daughter of John and Amy Amis
or Amies, was
<span class = "pagenum">xvii</span>
baptized together with her brother Peter in the Parish Church of SS.
Gregory and Martin, Wye, 10 July, 1640, presumably by Ambrose Richmore,
curate of Wye at that date.<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5"
href = "#note5">5</a> Up to this time Aphra’s maiden name has been
stated to be Johnson, and she is asserted to have been the daughter of a
barber, John Johnson. That the name was not Johnson (an&nbsp;ancient
error) is certain from the baptismal register, wherein, moreover, the
‘Quality, Trade, or Profession’ is left blank; that her father was a
barber rests upon no other foundation than a MS. note of Lady
Winchilsea.<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href =
"#note6">6</a> Mr. Gosse, in a most valuable article (<i>Athenæum</i>,
6&nbsp;September, 1884), was the first to correct the statement
repeatedly made that Mrs. Behn came from ‘the City of Canterbury in
Kent’. He tells how he acquired a folio volume containing the MS. poems
of Anne, Countess of Winchilsea,<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id =
"tag7" href = "#note7">7</a> ‘copied about 1695 under her eye and with
innumerable notes and corrections in her autograph’. In a certain poem
entitled <i>The Circuit of Apollo</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag8" id =
"tag8" href = "#note8">8</a> the following lines occur:&mdash;</p>
<span class = "pagenum">xviii</span>
<p class = "verse">
And standing where sadly he now might descry<br>
From the banks of the Stowre the desolate Wye,<br>
He lamented for Behn, o’er that place of her birth,<br>
And said amongst Women there was not on the earth,<br>
Her superior in fancy, in language, or witt,<br>
Yet own’d that a little too loosely she writt.</p>

<p>To these is appended this note: ‘Mrs. Behn was Daughter to a Barber,
who liv’d formerly in Wye, a&nbsp;little Market Town (now much decay’d)
in Kent. Though the account of her life before her Works pretends
otherwise; some Persons now alive Do testify upon their Knowledge that
to be her Original.’ It is a pity that whilst the one error concerning
Aphra’s birthplace is thus remedied, the mistake as to the nature of her
father’s calling should have been initiated.</p>

<p>Aphra Amis, then, was born early in July, 1640, at Wye, Kent. When
she was of a tender age the Amis family left England for Surinam; her
father, who seems to have been a relative of Francis, Lord Willoughby of
Parham, sometime administrator of several British colonies in the West
Indies, having been promised a post of some importance in these
dependencies. John Amis died on the voyage out, but his widow and
children necessarily continued their journey, and upon their arrival
were accommodated at St. John’s Hill, one of the best houses in the
district. Her life and adventures in Surinam Aphra has herself
realistically told in that wonderfully vivid narrative, <i>Oroonoko</i>.
<a class = "tag" name = "tag9" id = "tag9" href = "#note9">9</a> The
writer’s bent
<span class = "pagenum">xix</span>
had already shown itself. She kept a journal as many girls will, she
steeped herself in the interminable romances fashionable at that time,
in the voluminous <i>Pharamond</i>, <i>Cléopatre</i>, <i>Cassandre</i>,
<i>Ibrahim</i>, and, above all, <i>Le Grand Cyrus</i>, so loved and
retailed to the annoyance of her worthy husband by Mrs. Pepys; with a
piece of which Dorothy Osborne was ‘hugely pleased’.</p>

<p>It was perhaps from the reading of La Calprenède and Mlle de Scudéri
Aphra gained that intimate knowledge of French which served her well and
amply in after years during her literary life; at any rate she seems
early to have realized her dramatic genius and to have begun a play
drawn from one of the most interesting episodes in <i>Cléopatre</i>, the
love story of the Scythian King Alcamène, scenes which, when they had
‘measured three thousand leagues of spacious ocean’, were, nearly a
quarter of a century later, to be taken out of her desk and worked up
into a baroque and fanciful yet strangely pleasing tragi-comedy, <i>The
Young King</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">xx</span>
In Surinam she witnessed the fortunes and fate of the Royal Slave,
Oroonoko, of whom she writes (with all due allowance for pardonable
exaggeration and purely literary touches), so naturally and feelingly,
that ‘one of the Fair Sex’ with some acerbity makes it her rather
unnecessary business to clear Aphra from any suspicion of a liaison. It
was Surinam which supplied the cognate material for the vivid comedy,
the broad humour and early colonial life, photographic in its realism,
of <i>The Widow Ranter; or, The History of Bacon in Virginia</i>.
Mistakes there may be, errors and forgetfulness, but there are a
thousand touches which only long residence and keen observation could
have so deftly characterized.</p>

<p>We now approach a brief yet important period in Mrs. Behn’s life,
which unless we are content to follow (with an acknowledged diffidence
and due reservations) the old Memoir and scattered tradition, we find
ourselves with no sure means whatsoever of detailing. It seems probable,
however, that about the close of 1663, owing no doubt to the Restoration
and the subsequent changes in affairs, the Amis family returned to
England, settling in London, where Aphra, meeting a merchant of Dutch
extraction named Behn, so fascinated him by her wit and comeliness that
he offered her his hand and fortune. During her married life she is said
to have been in affluence, and even to have appeared at the gay
licentious Court, attracting the notice of and amusing the King himself
by her anecdotes and cleverness of repartee; but when her husband died,
not impossibly of the plague in the year of mortality, 1665, she found
herself helpless, without
<span class = "pagenum">xxi</span>
friends or funds. In her distress it was to the Court she applied for
assistance; and owing to her cosmopolitan experience and still more to
the fact that her name was Dutch, and that she had been by her husband
brought into close contact with the Dutch, she was selected as a meet
political agent to visit Holland and there be employed in various secret
and semi-official capacities. The circumstance that her position and
work could never be openly recognized nor acknowledged by the English
government was shortly to involve her in manifold difficulties,
pecuniary and otherwise, which eventually led to her perforce abandoning
so unstable and unsatisfactory a commission.</p>

<p>In the old <i>History of the Life and Memoirs of Mrs. Behn</i> (1696;
and with additions 1698, &amp;c.), ushered into the world by Charles
Gildon, a&nbsp;romance full as amorous and sensational as any novel of
the day, has been woven about her sojourn at Antwerp. A&nbsp;’Spark whom
we must call by the name of <i>Vander Albert</i> of <i>Utrecht</i>’ is
given to Aphra as a fervent lover, and from him she obtains political
secrets to be used to the English advantage. He has a rival, an antique
yclept Van Bruin, ‘a <i>Hogen Mogen</i> ... <i>Nestorean</i>’ admirer,
and the intrigue becomes fast and furious. On one occasion Albert,
imagining he is possessing his mistress, is cheated with a certain
Catalina; and again when he has bribed an ancient duenna to admit him to
Aphra’s bed, he is surprised there by a frolicsome gallant. <a class =
"tag" name = "tag10" id = "tag10" href = "#note10">10</a>
<span class = "pagenum">xxii</span>
There are even included five letters from Mrs. Behn and a couple of
ridiculous effusions purporting to be Van Bruin’s. It would seem that
all this pure fiction, the sweepings of Aphra’s desk, was intended by
her to have been worked up into a novel; both letters and narrative are
too good to be the unaided composition of Gildon himself, but possibly
Mrs. Behn in her after life may have elaborated and told him these
erotic episodes to conceal the squalor and misery of the real facts of
her early Dutch mission. It is proved indeed in aim and circumstance to
have been far other.</p>

<p>Her chief business was to establish an intimacy with William Scott,
son of Thomas Scott, the regicide who had been executed 17 October,
1660. This William, who had been made a fellow of All Souls by the
Parliamentary Visitors of Oxford, and graduated B.C.L. 4&nbsp;August,
1648, was quite ready to become a spy in the English service and to
report on the doings of the English exiles who were not only holding
treasonable correspondence with traitors at home and plotting against
the King, but even joining with the Dutch foe to injure their native
land. Scott was extremely anxious for his own pardon and, in addition,
eager to earn any money he could.</p>

<p>Aphra then, taking with her some forty pounds in cash, all she had,
set sail with Sir Anthony Desmarces <a class = "tag" name = "tag11" id =
"tag11" href = "#note11">11</a> either at the latter end of July or
early in August, 1666, and on 16 August she writes from Antwerp to say
she has had an interview with William Scott (dubbed in her
correspondence
<span class = "pagenum">xxiii</span>
Celadon), even having gone so far as to take coach and ride a day’s
journey to see him secretly. Though at first diffident, he is very ready
to undertake the service, only it will be necessary for her to enter
Holland itself and reside on the spot, not in Flanders, as Colonel
Bampfield, who was looked upon as head of the exiled English at the
Hague, watched Scott with most jealous care and a growing suspicion.
Aphra, whose letters give a vivid picture of the spy’s life with its
risks and impecuniosity, addresses herself to two correspondents, Tom
Killigrew and James Halsall, cupbearer to the King.</p>

<p>On 27 August she was still at Antwerp, and William Scott wrote to her
there but did not venture to say much lest the epistle might miscarry.
He asks for a cypher, a&nbsp;useful and indeed necessary precaution in
so difficult circumstances. It was about this time that Mrs. Behn began
to employ the name of Astrea, which, having its inception in a political
code, was later to be generally used by her and recognized throughout
the literary world. Writing to Halsall, she says that she has been
unable to effect anything, but she urgently demands that money be sent,
and confesses she has been obliged even to pawn her ring to pay
messengers. On 31 August she writes to Killigrew declaring she can get
no answer from Halsall, and explaining that she has twice had to
disburse Scott’s expenses, amounting in all to £20, out of her own
pocket, whilst her personal debts total another £25 or £30, and living
itself is ten guilders a day. If she is to continue her work
satisfactorily, £80 at least will be needed to pay up all her creditors;
moreover, as a
<span class = "pagenum">xxiv</span>
preliminary and a token of good faith, Scott’s official pardon must be
forwarded without compromise or delay. Scott himself was, it seems,
playing no easy game at this juncture, for a certain Carney, resident at
Antwerp, ‘an unsufferable, scandalous, lying, prating fellow’, piqued at
not being able to ferret out the intrigue, had gone so far as to molest
poor Celadon and threaten him with death, noising up and down meanwhile
the fact of his clandestine rendezvous with Aphra. No money, however,
was forthcoming from England, and on 4&nbsp;September Mrs. Behn writing
again to Killigrew tells him plainly that she is reduced to great
straits, and unless funds are immediately provided all her work will be
nugatory and vain. The next letter, dated 14 September, gives Halsall
various naval information. On 17 September she is obliged to importune
Killigrew once more on the occasion of sending him a letter from Scott
dealing with political matters. Halsall, she asserts, will not return
any answer, and although she is only in private lodgings she is
continually being thwarted and <ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged">vilipended</ins> by Carney, ‘whose tongue needs clipping’.
Four days later she transmits a five page letter from Scott to Halsall.
On 25 September she sends under cover yet another letter from Scott with
the news of De Ruyter’s illness. Silence was her only answer. Capable
and indeed ardent agent as she was, there can be no excuse for her
shameful, nay, criminal, neglect at the hands of the government she was
serving so faithfully and well. Her information<a class = "tag" name =
"tag12" id = "tag12" href = "#note12">12</a>
<span class = "pagenum">xxv</span>
seems to have been received with inattention and disregard; whether it
was that culpable carelessness which wrecked so many a fair scheme in
the second Charles’ days, or whether secret enemies at home steadfastly
impeded her efforts remains an open question. In any case on
3&nbsp;November she sends a truly piteous letter to Lord Arlington,
Secretary of State, and informs him she is suffering the extremest want
and penury. All her goods are pawned, Scott is in prison for debt, and
she herself seems on the point of going to the common gaol. The day
after Christmas Aphra wrote to Lord Arlington for the last time. She
asks for a round £100 as delays have naturally doubled her expenses and
she has had to obtain credit. Now she is only anxious to return home,
and she declares that if she did not so well know the justness of her
cause and complaint, she would be stark wild with her hard treatment.
Scott, she adds, will soon be free.<a class = "tag" name = "tag13" id =
"tag13" href = "#note13">13</a> Even this final appeal obtained no
response, and at length&mdash;well nigh desperate&mdash;Mrs. Behn
negotiated in England, from a certain Edward Butler, a&nbsp;private loan
of some £150 which enabled her to settle her affairs and start for home
in January, 1667.</p>

<p>But the chapter of her troubles was by no means ended. Debt weighed
like a millstone round her neck. As the weary months went by and Aphra
was begging in vain for her salary, long overdue, to be paid, Butler,
a&nbsp;harsh, dour man with heart of
<span class = "pagenum">xxvi</span>
stone, became impatient and resorted to drastic measures, eventually
flinging her into a debtor’s prison. There are extant three petitions,
undated indeed, but which must be referred to the early autumn of 1668,
from Mrs. Behn to Charles II. Sadly complaining of two years’ bitter
sufferings, she prays for an order to Mr. May<a class = "tag" name =
"tag14" id = "tag14" href = "#note14">14</a> or Mr. Chiffinch<a class =
"tag" name = "tag15" id = "tag15" href = "#note15">15</a> to satisfy
Butler, who declares he will stop at nothing if he is not paid within a
week. In a second document she sets out the reasons for her urgent claim
of £150. Both Mr. Halsall and Mr. Killigrew know how justly it is her
due, and she is hourly threatened with an execution. To this is annexed
a letter from the poor distracted woman to Killigrew, which runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>There was no immediate response however, even to this pathetic and
heart-broken appeal, and in yet a third petition she pleads that she may
not be left to suffer, but that the £150 be sent forthwith to Edward
Butler, who on Lord Arlington’s declaring that neither order nor money
had been transmitted, threw her straightway into gaol.</p>

<p>It does not seem, however, that her imprisonment was long. Whether
Killigrew, of whom later she spoke in warm and admiring terms, touched
at last, bestirred himself on her behalf and rescued her from want and
woe, whether Mrs. Amy Amis won a way to the King, whether help came by
some other path, is all uncertain. In any case the debt was duly paid,
and Aphra Behn not improbably received in addition some compensation for
the hardships she had undergone.</p>

<p>’The rest of her Life was entirely dedicated to Pleasure and Poetry;
the Success in which gain’d her the Acquaintance and Friendship of the
most Sensible Men of the Age, and the Love of not a few of different
Characters; for tho’ a Sot have no Portion of Wit of his own, he yet,
like old Age, covets what he cannot enjoy.’</p>

<p>More than dubious and idly romancing as the early <i>Memoirs</i> are,
nevertheless this one sentence seems to sum up the situation thenceforth
pretty aptly, if in altogether too general terms. Once extricated from
these main difficulties Mrs. Behn
<span class = "pagenum">xxviii</span>
no doubt took steps to insure that she should not, if it lay in her
power, be so situated again. I&nbsp;would suggest, indeed, that about
this period, 1669, she accepted the protection of some admirer. Who he
may have been at first, how many more there were than one, how long the
various amours endured, it is idle to speculate. She was for her period
as thoroughly unconventional as many another woman of letters has been
since in relation to later times and manners, as unhampered and free as
her witty successor, Mrs. de la Riviere Manley, who lived for so long as
Alderman Barber’s kept mistress and died in his house. Mrs. Behn has
given us poetic pseudonyms for many of her lovers, Lycidas, Lysander,
Philaster, Amintas, Alexis, and the rest, but these extended over many
years, and attempts at identification, however interesting, are
fruitless.<a class = "tag" name = "tag16" id = "tag16" href =
"#note16">16</a></p>

<p>There has been no more popular mistake, nor yet one more productive,
not merely of nonsense and bad criticism but even of actual malice and
evil, than the easy error of confounding an author with the characters
he creates. Mrs. Behn has not been spared. Some have superficially
argued from the careless levity of her heroes: the Rover, Cayman,
Wittmore, Wilding, Frederick; and again from the delightful insouciance
of Lady Fancy, Queen Lucy, and the genteel coquette Mirtilla, or the
torrid passions of Angelica Bianca, Miranda and la Nuche; that Aphra
herself was little better, in fact a great deal worse, than a
<span class = "pagenum">xxix</span>
common prostitute, and that her works are undiluted pornography.</p>

<p>In her own day, probably for reasons purely political, a&nbsp;noisy
clique assailed her on the score of impropriety; a&nbsp;little later
came Pope with his jaded couplet</p>

<p class = "verse">
The stage how loosely does Astrea tread<br>
Who fairly puts all characters to bed;</p>

<p>and the attack was reinforced by an anecdote of Sir Walter Scott and
some female relative who, after having insisted upon the great novelist
lending her Mrs. Behn, found the <i>Novels</i> and <i>Plays</i> too
loose for her perusal, albeit in the heyday of the lady’s youth they had
been popular enough. As one might expect, Miss Julia Kavanagh, in the
mid-Victorian era<a class = "tag" name = "tag17" id = "tag17" href =
"#note17">17</a> (<i>English Women of Letters</i> 1863), is sad and
sorry at having to mention Mrs. Behn&mdash;’Even if her life remained
pure,<a class = "tag" name = "tag18" id = "tag18" href =
"#note18">18</a> it is amply evident her mind was “tainted to the very
core. Grossness was congenial to her.... Mrs. Behn’s indelicacy was
useless and worse than useless, the superfluous addition of a corrupt
mind and vitiated taste”.’ One can afford to smile at and ignore these
modest outbursts, but it is strange to find so sound and sane a critic
as Dr. Doran writing of Aphra Behn as follows: ‘No one equalled this
woman in downright nastiness save
<span class = "pagenum">xxx</span>
Ravenscroft and Wycherley.... With Dryden she vied in indecency and was
not overcome.... She was a mere harlot, who danced through uncleanness
and dared them [the male dramatists] to follow.’ Again, we have that she
was ‘a wanton hussy’; her ‘trolloping muse’ shamefacedly ‘wallowed in
the mire’; but finally the historian is bound to confess ‘she was never
dull’.</p>

<p>The morality of her plays is <i>au fond</i> that of many a comedy of
to-day: that the situations and phrasing in which she presents her
amorous intrigues and merry cuckoldoms do not conform with modern
exposition of these themes we also show yet would not name, is but our
surface gloss of verbal reticence; we hint, point, and suggest, where
she spoke out broad words, frank and free; the <i>motif</i> is one and
the same. If we judge Mrs. Behn’s dramatic output in the only fair way
by comparing it legitimately with the theatre of her age, we simply
shall not find that superfluity of naughtiness the critics lead us to
expect and deplore. There are not infrequent scenes of Dryden, of
Wycherley, of Vanbrugh, Southerne, Otway, Ravenscroft, Shadwell,
D’Urfey, Crowne, full as daring as anything Aphra wrote; indeed, in some
instances, far more wanton. Particularizing, it has been objected that
although in most Restoration comedies the hero, however vicious (even
such a mad <ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged">scrapegrace</ins>
as Dryden’s Woodall), is decently noosed up
in wedlock when the curtain is about to fall, Mrs. Behn’s Willmore
(<i>Rover&nbsp;II</i>), Gayman (<i>The Lucky Chance</i>), Wittmore
(<i>Sir Patient Fancy</i>) end up without a thought of, save it be jest
at, the wedding ring. But even this freedom can
<span class = "pagenum">xxxi</span>
be amply paralleled. In the Duke of Buckingham’s clever alteration of
<i>The Chances</i> (1682), we have Don John pairing off with the second
Constantia without a hint of matrimony; we have the intrigue of Bellmour
and Laetitia in Congreve’s <i>The Old Bachelor</i> (1693), the amours of
Horner in <i>The Country Wife</i> (1675), of Florio and Artall in
Crowne’s <i>City Politics</i> (1683), and many another beside. As for
the cavilling crew who carped at her during her life Mrs. Behn has
answered them and she was thoroughly competent so to do. Indeed, as she
somewhat tartly remarked to Otway on the occasion of certain prudish
dames pleasing to take offence at <i>The Soldier’s Fortune</i>, she
wondered at the impudence of any of her sex that would pretend to
understand the thing called bawdy. A&nbsp;clique were shocked at her; it
was not her salaciousness they objected to but her success.</p>

<p>In December, 1670, Mrs. Behn’s first play,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag19" id = "tag19" href = "#note19">19</a> <i>The Forc’d Marriage; or,
the Jealous Bridegroom</i>, was produced at the Duke’s Theatre,
Lincoln’s Inn <ins class = "correction" title = "apostrophe in original">Field’s</ins>,
with a strong cast. It is a good tragi-comedy
of the bastard Fletcherian Davenant type, but she had not hit upon her
happiest vein of comedy, which, however, she approached in a much better
piece, <i>The Amorous Prince</i>, played in the autumn of 1671 by the
same company. Both these had excellent runs for their day, and she
obtained a firm footing
<span class = "pagenum">xxxii</span>
in the theatrical world. In 1673<a class = "tag" name = "tag20" id =
"tag20" href = "#note20">20</a> <i>The Dutch Lover</i><a class = "tag"
name = "tag21" id = "tag21" href = "#note21">21</a> was ready,
a&nbsp;comedy which has earned praise for its skilful technique. She
here began to draw on her own experiences for material, and Haunce van
Ezel owes not a little to her intimate knowledge of the Hollanders.</p>

<p>These three plays brought her money, friends, and reputation. She was
already beginning to be a considerable figure in literary circles, and
the first writers of the day were glad of the acquaintance of a woman
who was both a wit and a writer. There is still retailed a vague,
persistent, and entirely baseless tradition that Aphra Behn was assisted
in writing her plays by Edward Ravenscroft,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag22" id = "tag22" href = "#note22">22</a> the well known dramatist.
Mrs. Behn often alludes in her prefaces to the prejudice a carping
clique entertained against her and the strenuous efforts that were made
to damn her comedies merely because they were ‘writ by a woman’.
Accordingly, when her plays succeeded, this same party, unable to deny
such approved and patent merit, found their excuse in spreading a report
that she was not inconsiderably aided in her scenes by another hand.
Edward
<span class = "pagenum">xxxiii</span>
Ravenscroft’s name stands to the epilogue of <i>Sir Timothy Tawdrey</i>,
and he was undoubtedly well acquainted with Mrs. Behn. Tom Brown
(I&nbsp;suggest) hints at a known intrigue,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag23" id = "tag23" href = "#note23">23</a> but, even if my surmise be
correct, there is nothing in this to warrant the oft repeated statement
that many of her scenes are actually due to his pen. On the other hand,
amongst Aphra’s intimates was a certain John Hoyle, a&nbsp;lawyer, well
known about the town as a wit. John Hoyle was the son of Thomas Hoyle,
Alderman and Lord Mayor of, and M.P. for York, who hanged himself<a
class = "tag" name = "tag24" id = "tag24" href = "#note24">24</a> at the
same hour as Charles&nbsp;I was beheaded. In the Gray’s Inn Admission
Register we have: ‘1659/60 Feb. 27. John Hoyle son and heir of Thomas H.
late of the city of York, Esq. deceased.’ Some eighteen years after he
was admitted to the Inner Temple: ‘1678/9 Jan. 26. Order that John Hoyle
formerly of Gray’s Inn be admitted
<span class = "pagenum">xxxiv</span>
to this society <i>ad eundem statum</i>. (<i>Inner Temple Records</i>,
iii, 131.) There are allusions not a few to him in Mrs. Behn’s poems; he
is the Mr. J.&nbsp;H. of <i>Our Cabal</i>; and in ‘A&nbsp;Letter to Mr.
<i>Creech</i> at <i>Oxford</i>, Written in the last great Frost,’ which
finds a place in the <i>Miscellany</i> of 1685, the following lines
occur:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">

A Wit that wou’d be proud t’ have known ye;<br>

<p>There can be no doubt he was on terms of the closest familiarity<a
class = "tag" name = "tag25" id = "tag25" href = "#note25">25</a> with
Mrs. Behn, and he (if&nbsp;any), not Ravenscroft, assisted her (though
we are not to suppose to a real extent) in her plays. There is a very
plain allusion to this in Radcliffe’s <i>The Ramble: News from Hell</i>
(1682):&mdash;</p>

<p>Unfortunately Hoyle was reputed to be addicted to the grossest
immorality, and rumours of a sinister
<span class = "pagenum">xxxv</span>
description were current concerning him.<a class = "tag" name = "tag27"
id = "tag27" href = "#note27">27</a> There is, in fact, printed a
letter<a class = "tag" name = "tag28" id = "tag28" href =
"#note28">28</a> of Mrs. Behn’s wherein she writes most anxiously to her
friend stating that the gravest scandals have reached her ears, and
begging him to clear himself from these allegations. Hoyle was murdered
in a brawl 26&nbsp;May, 1692, and is buried in the vault belonging to
the Inner Temple, which is presumably in the ground attached to the
Temple Church. The entry in the Register runs as follows: ‘John Hoyle,
esq., of the Inner Temple was buried in the vault May ye&nbsp;29, 1692.’
Narcissus Luttrell in his <i>Diary</i>, Saturday, 28&nbsp;May, 1692, has
the following entry: ‘Mr. Hoil of the Temple on Thursday night was at a
tavern with other gentlemen, and quarrelling with Mr. Pitts’ eldest son
about drinking a health, as they came out Mr. Hoil was stabb’d in the
belly and fell down dead, and thereon Pitts fled; and the next morning
was taken in a disguise and is committed
<span class = "pagenum">xxxvi</span>
to Newgate.’<a class = "tag" name = "tag29" id = "tag29" href =
"#note29">29</a> 30 June, 1692, the same record says: ‘This day Mr.
Pitts was tryed at the Old Bailey for the murder of Mr. Hoil of the
Temple, and the jury found it manslaughter but the next heir has brought
an appeal.’</p>

<p>In September, 1676, <i>The Town Fop</i> was acted with applause, and
the following year Mrs. Behn was very busy producing two comedies
(of&nbsp;which one is a masterpiece) and one tragedy. <i>The
Debauchee</i>, which was brought out this year at the Duke’s House,
a&nbsp;somewhat superficial though clever alteration of Brome’s <i>Mad
Couple Well Match’d</i>, is no doubt from her pen. It was published
anonymously, 4to, 1677, and all the best critics with one accord ascribe
it to Mrs. Behn. In the autumn of 1677 there was produced by the Duke’s
Company a version of Middleton’s <i>No Wit, No Help Like a Woman’s</i>,
entitled, <i>The Counterfeit Bridegroom; or, The Defeated Widow</i>
(4to, 1677); it is smart and spirited. Genest was of opinion it is
Aphra’s work. He is probably right, for we know that she repeatedly made
use of Middleton, and internal evidence fully
<span class = "pagenum">xxxvii</span>
bears out our stage historian.<a class = "tag" name = "tag30" id =
"tag30" href = "#note30">30</a> Both <i>Abdelazer</i><a class = "tag"
name = "tag31" id = "tag31" href = "#note31">31</a> and <i>The Town
Fop</i> evidence in a marked degree her intimate knowledge of the
earlier dramatists, whilst <i>The Rover (I)</i> is founded on Killigrew.
None the less, here she has handled her materials with rare skill, and
successfully put new wine into old bottles. The critics, however, began
to attack her on this point, and when <i>The Rover (I)</i> appeared in
print (4to 1677), she found it necessary to add a postscript, defending
her play from the charge of merely being ’<i>Thomaso</i> alter’d’. With
reference to <i>Abdelazer</i> there is extant a very interesting
letter<a class = "tag" name = "tag32" id = "tag32" href =
"#note32">32</a> from Mrs. Behn to her friend, Mrs. Emily Price. She
writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "inset two">
My Dear,</p>

<p class = "inset">
In your last, you inform’d me, that the World treated me as a
<i>Plagiery</i>, and, I&nbsp;must confess, not with Injustice: But that
Mr. <i>Otway</i> shou’d say, my Sex wou’d not prevent my being pull’d to
Pieces by the Criticks, is something odd, since whatever Mr.
<i>Otway</i> now declares, he may very well remember when last I saw
him, I&nbsp;receiv’d more than ordinary Encomiums on my
<i>Abdelazer</i>, But every one knows Mr. <i>Otway’s</i> good Nature,
which will not permit him to shock any one of our Sex to their Faces.
<span class = "pagenum">xxxviii</span>
But let that pass: For being impeach’d of murdering my <i>Moor</i>,
I&nbsp;am thankful, since, when I shall let the World know, whenever I
take the Pains next to appear in Print, of the mighty Theft I have been
guilty of; But however for your own Satisfaction, I&nbsp;have sent you
the Garden from whence I gather’d, and I hope you will not think me
vain, if I say, I&nbsp;have weeded and improv’d it. I&nbsp;hope to
prevail on the Printer to reprint <i>The Lust’s Dominion</i>, &amp;c.,
that my theft may be the more publick. But I detain you. I&nbsp;believe
I sha’n’t have the Happiness of seeing my dear <i>Amillia</i> ’till the
middle of <i>September</i>: But be assur’d I shall always remain as I
am,</p>

<p class = "inset four">
Yours, A. Behn.</p>

<p><i>The Rover (I)</i> is undoubtedly the best known of Aphra Behn’s
comedies. It long remained a popular favourite in the theatre, its
verve, bustle and wit, utterly defiant of the modest Josephs and qualmy
prudes who censured these lively scenes. Steele has mention of this in
an archly humorous paper, No. 51, <i>Spectator</i>, Saturday, 28 April,
1711. He pictures a young lady who has taken offence at some negligent
expression in that chastest of ice-cold proprieties, <i>The Funeral</i>,
and he forthwith more or less seriously proceeds to defend his play by
quoting the example of both predecessors and contemporaries. Amongst the
writers who are ‘best skilled in this luscious Way’, he informs us that
‘we are obliged to the Lady who writ <i>Ibrahim</i> <a class = "tag"
name = "tag33" id = "tag33" href = "#note33">33</a> for introducing a
preparatory Scene to the very Action, when the Emperor throws his
Handkerchief as a Signal for his Mistress to follow him
<span class = "pagenum">xxxix</span>
into the most retired Part of the Seraglio.... This ingenious
Gentlewoman in this piece of Baudry refined upon an Author of the same
Sex, who in <i>The Rover</i> makes a Country Squire strip to his Holland
Drawers. For <i>Blunt</i> is disappointed, and the Emperor is understood
to go on to the utmost.... It is not here to be omitted, that in one of
the above-mentioned Female Compositions the <i>Rover</i> is very
frequently sent on the same Errand; as I take it above once every Act.
This is not wholly unnatural; for, they say, the Men-Authors draw
themselves in their Chief Characters, and the Women-Writers may be
allowed the same Liberty.’</p>

<p>Early in 1678, in either the first or second week of January, <i>Sir
Patient Fancy</i> was received with great applause. A&nbsp;hint from
Brome, more than a hint from Molière, much wit, vivacity, and cleverness
make up this admirable comedy. Throughout the whole of her career it is
amply evident that Mrs. Behn, an omnivorous reader, kept in constant
touch with and profited by the French literature and theatre of her day.
The debt of the English stage to France at this period is a fact often
not sufficiently acknowledged, but one which it would really be
difficult to over-emphasize. No adequate critical knowledge of much of
our English song, fiction and drama of the Restoration can be attained
without a close study of their French models and originals.</p>

<p>During the latter part of this year Mrs. Behn found time to revise
and write up the romantic scenes she had composed two decades before as
a girl in Surinam, and the result was a tragi-comedy,
<span class = "pagenum">xl</span>
<i>The Young King</i>, which won considerable favour. Produced in March
or early April,<a class = "tag" name = "tag34" id = "tag34" href =
"#note34">34</a> 1679, it was not published till 1683, but a second
edition was called for in 1698.<a class = "tag" name = "tag35" id =
"tag35" href = "#note35">35</a></p>

<p>In March, <i>The Feign’d Courtezans</i>, one of Mrs. Behn’s happiest
efforts, appeared on the boards of the Duke’s House. Not one tittle is
borrowed, and its success gives striking proof of the capacity of her
unaided powers. When printed, the comedy was dedicated in adulatory
terms to Nell Gwynne. With the great Betterton, handsome Will Smith,
Nokes, Underhill, Leigh, an inimitable trio, the famous Mrs. Barry,
pretty and piquante Betty Currer, the beautiful and serenely gracious
Mrs. Mary Lee, in the cast, it had a perfect galaxy of genius to give it
life and triumph.</p>

<p>In 1681 a second part continued the adventures of <i>The Rover</i>,
and surprisingly good the sequel&nbsp;is.</p>

<p>From 1678 to 1683 were years of the keenest political excitement and
unrest. Fomented to frenzy by the murderous villainies of Gates and his
accomplices, aggravated by the traitrous ambition and rascalities of
Shaftesbury, by the deceit and weakness of Monmouth, and the open
disloyalty of the Whiggish crew, party politics and controversy waxed
hotter and fiercer until riots were common and a
<span class = "pagenum">xli</span>
revolution seemed imminent. Fortunately an appeal in a royal declaration
to the justice of the nation at large allayed the storm, and an
overwhelming outburst of genuine enthusiasm ensued. Albeit the bill
against him was thrown out with an ‘ignoramus’ by a packed jury 24
November, 1681, a&nbsp;year later, 28 November, 1682, Shaftesbury found
it expedient to escape to Holland. Monmouth, who had been making a regal
progress through the country, was arrested. Shortly after he was bailed
out by his political friends, but he presently fled in terror lest he
should pay the penalty of his follies and crimes, inasmuch as a true
bill for high treason had been found against him. It was natural that at
such a crisis the stage and satire (both prose and rhyme), should become
impregnated with party feeling; and the Tory poets, with glorious John
Dryden at their head, unmercifully pilloried their adversaries. In 1682
Mrs. Behn produced three comedies, two of which are mainly political.
<i>The Roundheads</i>, a&nbsp;masterly pasquinade, shows the Puritans,
near ancestors of the Whigs, in their most odious and veritable colours.
<i>The City Heiress</i> lampoons Shaftesbury and his cit following in
exquisite caricature. The wit and humour, the pointed raillery never
coarsening into mere invective and zany burlesque, place this in the
very front rank of her comedies.<a class = "tag" name = "tag36" id =
"tag36" href = "#note36">36</a> <i>The False</i>
<span class = "pagenum">xlii</span>
<i>Count</i>, the third play of this year, is non-political, and she has
herein borrowed a suggestion from Molière. It is full of brilliant
dialogue and point, whilst the situations are truly ludicrous and
entertaining. As might well be surmised, <i>The Roundheads</i> and
<i>The City Heiress</i> were not slow to wake the rancour of the Whigs,
who looked about for an opportunity of vengeance which they shortly
found. On 10&nbsp;August, 1682, there was produced at the Duke’s Theatre
an anonymous tragedy <i>Romulus and Hersilia; or, The Sabine War</i>. It
is a vigorous play of no small merit and attracted considerable
attention at the time.<a class = "tag" name = "tag37" id = "tag37" href
= "#note37">37</a> Mrs. Behn contributed both Prologue and Epilogue, the
former being spoken by that sweet-voiced blonde, winsome Charlotte
Butler, the latter by Lady Slingsby, who acted Tarpeia. There was matter
in the Epilogue which reflected upon the disgraced Duke of Monmouth, for
whom, in spite of his known treachery and treasons, Charles still
retained the fondest affection. Warm representations were made in high
quarters, and the following warrant was speedily issued:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "inset">
Whereas the Lady Slingsby Comoedian and Mrs. Aphaw Behen have by acting

Warr’t. Given und’r my hand and seale this 12’th day of August,
1682.</p>

<p class = "inset three">
To Henry Legatt Messenger<br>
of His Mat’ties Chamber, etc.</p>

<p>The lines particularly complained of ran as follows:</p>

<p class = "verse">

accurst;</span><br>
Rebelling ’gainst a KING and FATHER first.<br>

With all the <i>True</i>, the <i>Loyal</i> and the <i>Brave</i>;<br>
Not my Remorse or death can Expiate<br>
With them a Treason ’gainst the KING and State.</p>

<p>Coming from the mouth of the perjured Tarpeia they were of course
winged with point unmistakable. It is not probable, however, that either
authoress or actress was visited with anything more than censure and a
fright. In any case their detention<a class = "tag" name = "tag38" id =
"tag38" href = "#note38">38</a> (if&nbsp;brought about) must have been
very shortliv’d, for the partizans of Monmouth, although noisy and
unquiet, were not really strong, and they met with the most effective
opposition at every turn.</p>

<p>In this same year the Whigs in spite of their utmost efforts signally
failed to suppress, and could
<span class = "pagenum">xliv</span>
only retard the production of Dryden and Lee’s excellent tragedy <i>The
Duke of Guise</i>, first performed 4&nbsp;December. The play created a
furore, and its political purport as a picture of the baffled intrigues
of Shaftesbury in favour of Lucy Walter’s overweening son is obvious,
nor is it rendered less so by Dryden’s clever and caustic <i>Vindication
of the Duke of Guise</i> (1683). It is interesting to note that Lady
Slingsby, who played the Queen Mother, Catherine de’ Medici, in this
play, has some very sardonic speeches put in her mouth; indeed, as
Henri&nbsp;III aptly remarks,’she has a cruel wit’.</p>

<p>In 1684 were published the famous <i>Love Letters between a Nobleman
and his Sister</i>. The letters, supposed to have passed between Forde,
Lord Grey,<a class = "tag" name = "tag39" id = "tag39" href =
"#note39">39</a> and his sister-in-law Lady Henrietta Berkeley, fifth
daughter of the Earl, are certainly the work of Mrs. Behn. Romantic and
sentimental, with now and again a pretty touch that is almost lyrical in
its sweet cadence, they enjoyed the same extraordinary popularity which
very similar productions have attained at a recent date. A&nbsp;third
edition was called for in 1707.</p>

<p>Mrs. Behn was also busy seeing her poems through the press. The title
page is dated 1684, and they were issued with a dedication to the Earl
<span class = "pagenum">xlv</span>
of Salisbury.<a class = "tag" name = "tag40" id = "tag40" href =

<i>A Voyage to The Isle of Love</i>.</p>

<p>The following undated letter (preserved at Bayfordbury) addressed to
Jacob Tonson, and first published in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>,
May, 1836, pleads hard for an extra payment of five pounds for her book.
She writes:&mdash;</p>

infinitly for y<sup>e</sup> hon. he offers, and I shall never think I
can do any thing that can merritt so vast a glory; and I must owe it all
to you if I have it. As for Mr. Creech, I&nbsp;would not have you

<p class = "inset">
As for y<sup>e</sup> verses of mine, I&nbsp;shou’d really have thought

<span class = "pagenum">xlvi</span>
worth 25<i>l</i>; not that I shou’d dispute at any other time for
5&nbsp;pound wher I am so obleeged; but you can not think w<sup>t</sup>
a preety thing y<sup>e</sup> Island will be, and w<sup>t</sup> a deal of

by it self. But pray speake to yor Bro<sup>r</sup> to advance the price
to one 5lb more, ’twill at this time be more then given me, and I vow I
wou’d not aske it if I did not really believe it worth more. Alas I
wou’d not loose my time in such low gettings, but only since I am about
it I am resolv’d to go throw w<sup>th</sup> it tho I shou’d give it.
I&nbsp;pray go about it as soone as you please, for I shall finish as

<p>It is probable that about this date, 1683-4, she penned her little
novel <i>The Adventure of the Black Lady</i>, and also that excellent
extravaganza <i>The King of Bantam</i>.<a class = "tag" name = "tag42"
id = "tag42" href = "#note42">42</a> Both these and <i>The
Unfortunate</i>
<span class = "pagenum">xlvii</span>
<i>Happy Lady</i> are written as if they had certainly been completed
before the death of Charles&nbsp;II, in which case they must have lain
by, MSS, in Mrs. Behn’s desk.</p>

<p>The King, at the height of his power, after a short illness, died
6&nbsp;February, 1685, an event that together with the accession of
James naturally evoked a plethora of State Poems, to which flood Mrs.
Behn contributed. Her Pindarics rank high amongst the semi-official,
complimentary, threnodic or pastoral pseudo-Dithyrambs, of which the age
was so bounteous; but it needed the supreme genius of a Dryden
sustainedly to instil lyric fire and true poetry into these hybrid
forms.<a class = "tag" name = "tag43" id = "tag43" href =
"#note43">43</a> The nadir is sounded by the plumbeous productions of
Shadwell, Nahum Tate, and ‘Persons of Quality’. Aphra’s <i>Pindarick on
the Death of Charles&nbsp;II</i> ran through two editions in 1685, and
her <i>Poem to the Queen Dowager Catherine</i> was
<span class = "pagenum">xlviii</span>
published the same year. James&nbsp;II was crowned on St. George’s Day,
and she greeted her new monarch and old patron with a <i>Poem on the
Happy Coronation of His Sacred Majesty</i>. A&nbsp;little later she
published a <i>Miscellany</i> of poems by various hands: amongst whom
were Etheredge, Edmund Arwaker, Henry Crisp, and Otway, including not a
few from her own pen, ‘Together with Reflections on Morality, or Seneca
Unmasqued. Translated from the Maximes of the Duke de la Rochefoucauld’,
a&nbsp;number of clever apophthegms tersely turned.</p>

<p>The following note,<a class = "tag" name = "tag44" id = "tag44" href
= "#note44">44</a> however, affords ample evidence that at this
juncture, maugre her diligence and unremitting toils, she was far from
being in easy circumstances:&mdash;</p>

A. Behn.’</p>

<p>Early in 1686 a frolicksome comedy of great merit, <i>The Lucky
Chance</i>, was produced by her at the Theatre Royal, the home of the
United Companies. A&nbsp;Whiggish clique, unable to harm her in any
other way, banded together to damn the play and so endeavoured to raise
a pudic hubbub, that happily proved quite ineffective. <i>The Lucky
Chance</i>, which contends with <i>The Rover (I)</i>, and <i>The
Feign’d</i>
<span class = "pagenum">xlix</span>
<i>Courtezans</i> for the honour of being Mrs. Behn’s highest flight of
comic genius, has scenes admittedly wantoning beyond the bounds of
niggard propriety, but all are alive with a careless wit and a brilliant
humour that prove quite irresistible. Next appeared those graceful
translations from de Bonnecorse’s <i>La Montre ... seconde partie
contenant La Boëte et Le Miroir</i>, which she termed <i>The Lover’s
Watch</i> and <i>The Lady’s Looking-Glass</i>.</p>

<p>In 1687 the Duke of Albemarle’s voyage to Jamaica<a class = "tag"
name = "tag45" id = "tag45" href = "#note45">45</a> to take up the
government in the West Indies gave occasion for a Pindaric, but we only
have one dramatic piece from Mrs. Behn, <i>The Emperor of the Moon</i>,
a&nbsp;capital three act farce, Italian in sentiment and origin. For
some little time past her health had begun to trouble her.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag46" id = "tag46" href = "#note46">46</a> Her three
years of privation and cares had told upon her physically, and since
then, ‘forced to write for bread and not ashamed to own it,’ she had
spared neither mind nor bodily strength. Graver symptoms appeared, but
yet she found time to translate from Fontenelle his version of Van
Dale’s <i>De Oraculis Ethnicorum</i> as <i>The History of Oracles and
the Cheats of the Pagan Priests</i>, a&nbsp;book of great interest.
There was also published in 1687 an edition in stately folio of
<i>Æesop’s Fables with his Life in English, French and Latin</i>,
‘illustrated with One hundred and twelve Sculptures’ and ‘Thirty One New
Figures representing his Life’, by Francis Barlow, the celebrated
<span class = "pagenum">l</span>
draughtsman of birds and animals. Each plate to the Life has a quatrain
appended, and each fable with its moral is versified beneath the
accompanying picture. In his brief address to the Reader Barlow writes:
‘The Ingenious Mrs. A.&nbsp;Behn has been so obliging as to perform the
English Poetry, which in short comprehends the Sense of the Fable and
Moral; Whereof to say much were needless, since it may sufficiently
recommend it self to all Persons of Understanding.’ To this year we
further assign the composition of no fewer than four novels, <i>The
Unfortunate Bride</i>, <i>The Dumb Virgin</i>, <i>The Wandering
Beauty</i>, <i>The Unhappy Mistake</i>. She was working at high
pressure, and 1688 still saw a tremendous literary output. Waller had
died 21 October, 1687, at the great age of eighty-one, and her Elegiac
Ode to his Memory begins:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
How to thy Sacred Memory, shall I bring<br>

<p>Her weakness, lassitude, and despondency are more than apparent; yet
bravely buckling to her work, and encouraged by her success with
Fontenelle, she Englished with rare skill his <i>Theory of the System of
Several New Inhabited Worlds</i>, prefixing thereto a first-rate ‘Essay
on Translated Prose.’ She shows herself an admirable critic,
broad-minded, with a keen eye for niceties of style. <i>The Fair
Jilt</i> (licensed 17&nbsp;April, 1688),<a class = "tag" name = "tag48"
id = "tag48" href = "#note48">48</a> <i>Oroonoko</i>, and <i>Agnes de
Castro</i>, followed in swift succession. She also published <i>Lycidus,
a&nbsp;Voyage from the Island of Love</i>, returning to the Abbé
Tallemant’s dainty preciosities. On 10&nbsp;June, James Francis Edward,
<span class = "pagenum">lii</span>
Prince of Wales, was born at St. James’s Palace, and Mrs. Behn having
already written a <i>Congratulatory Poem</i><a class = "tag" name =
"tag49" id = "tag49" href = "#note49">49</a> to Queen Mary of Modena on
her expectation of the Prince, was ready with a Poem on his Happy
Birth.</p>

<p>One of the most social and convivial of women, a&nbsp;thorough Tory,
well known to Dryden, Creech, Otway and all the leading men of her day,
warm helper and ally of every struggling writer, Astrea began to be
completely overpowered by the continual strain, the unremittent tax upon
both health and time. Overworked and overwrought, in the early months of
1689 she put into English verse the sixth book (<i>of Trees</i>) from
Cowley’s <i>Sex Libri Plantarum</i> (1668). Nahum Tate undertook Books
IV and V and prefaced the translation when printed. As Mrs. Behn knew no
Latin no doubt some friend, perhaps Tate himself, must have paraphrased
the original for her. She further published <i>The Lucky Mistake</i> and
<i>The History of the Nun; or, The Fair Vow Breaker</i>,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag50" id = "tag50" href = "#note50">50</a> licensed
22&nbsp;October, 1688. On the afternoon of 12&nbsp;February, Mary, wife
of William of Orange, had with great diffidence landed at Whitehall
Stairs, and Mrs. Behn congratulated the lady in her Poem <i>To Her
Sacred Majesty Queen Mary on her Arrival in England</i>. One regrets to
find her writing on such an occasion, and that she realized the
impropriety of her conduct is clear from the reference to the banished
monarch. But she was weary, depressed,
<span class = "pagenum">liii</span>
and ill, and had indeed for months past been racked with incessant pain.
An agonizing complication of disorders now gave scant hope of recovery.
It is in the highest degree interesting to note that during her last
sickness Dr. Burnet, a&nbsp;figure of no little importance at that
moment, kindly enquired after the dying woman. The Pindaric in which she
thanks him, and which was printed March, 1689, proved the last poem she
herself saw through the press. At length exhausted nature failed
altogether, and she expired 16 April, 1689, the end hastened by a sad
lack of skill in her physician. She is buried in the east cloisters of
Westminster Abbey. A&nbsp;black marble slab marks the spot. On it are
graven ‘Mrs. Aphra Behn Dyed April, 16, <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1689,’ and two lines, ‘made by a very ingenious
Gentleman tho’ no Poet’:&mdash;<a class = "tag" name = "tag51" id =

<p>’She was of a generous and open Temper, something passionate, very
serviceable to her Friends in all that was in her Power; and could
sooner forgive an Injury, than do one. She had Wit, Honour, Good-Humour,
and Judgment. She was Mistress of all the pleasing Arts of Conversation,
<span class = "pagenum">liv</span>
but us’d ’em not to any but those who love Plain-dealing.’ So she comes
before us. A&nbsp;graceful, comely woman,<a class = "tag" name = "tag53"
id = "tag53" href = "#note53">53</a> merry and buxom, with brown hair
and bright eyes, candid, sincere, a&nbsp;brilliant conversationalist in
days when conversation was no mere slipshod gabble of slang but cut and
thrust of poignant epigram and repartee; warm-hearted, perhaps too
warm-hearted, and ready to lend a helping hand even to the most
undeserving, a&nbsp;quality which gathered all Grub Street round her
door. At a period when any and every writer, mean or great, of
whatsoever merit or party, was continually assailed with vehement satire
and acrid lampoons, lacking both truth and decency, Aphra Behn does not
come off scot-free, nobody did; and upon occasion her name is amply
vilified by her foes. There are some eight ungenerous lines with a side
reference to the ‘Conquests she had won’ in Buckingham’s <i>A&nbsp;Trial
of the Poets for the Bays</i>, and a page or two of insipid spiritless
rhymes, <i>The Female Laureat</i>, find a place in <i>State Poems</i>.
The same collection contains <i>A&nbsp;Satyr on the Modern

Thus let her write, but <i>Paraphrase</i> no more.</p>

<p>These verses are verjuiced, unwarranted, unfair. Tom Brown too in his
<i>Letters from the Dead to the Living</i> has a long epistle ‘From
worthy Mrs. Behn
<span class = "pagenum">lvi</span>
the Poetess, to the famous Virgin Actress,’ (Mrs. Bracegirdle), in which
the Diana of the stage is crudely rallied. ‘The Virgin’s Answer to Mrs.
Behn’ contains allusions to Aphra’s intrigue with some well-known
dramatic writer, perhaps Ravenscroft, and speaks of many an other amour
beside. But then for a groat Brown would have proved Barbara Villiers a
virgin, and taxed Torquemada with unorthodoxy. Brown has yet another
gird at Mrs. Behn in his <i>The Late Converts Exposed, or the Reason of
Mr. Bays’s Changing his Religion &amp;c.</i> Considered in a Dialogue
(1690, a&nbsp;quarto tract; and reprinted in a Collection of Brown’s
<i>Dialogues</i>, 8vo, 1704). Says Eugenius: ‘You may remember Mr. Bays,
how the famed <i>Astrea</i>, once in her Life-time unluckily lighted
upon such a Sacred Subject, and in a strange fit of Piety, must needs
attempt a Paraphrase on the Lord’s Prayer. But alas poor Gentlewoman!
She had scarce travell’d half way, when <i>Cupid</i> served her as the
Cut-Purse did the Old Justice in <i>Bartholmew</i> Fair, tickled her
with a Straw in her Ear, and then she could not budge one foot further,
till she had humbly requested her Maker to grant her a private Act of
Toleration for a little Harmless Love, otherwise called Fornication.’
There is a marginal note to this passage: ‘Mrs. <i>Behn’s</i> Miscell.
Printed by <i>Jos. Hindmarsh</i>.’ In <i>a Letter from the Dead Thomas
Brown to the Living Heraclitus</i> (1704), a&nbsp;sixpenny tract, this
wag is supposed to meet Mrs. Behn in the underworld, and anon
establishes himself on the most familiar terms with his ‘dear
<i>Afra</i>’; they take, indeed, ‘an extraordinary liking to one
<span class = "pagenum">lvii</span>
another’s Company’ for ‘good Conversation is not so overplentiful in
these Parts.’ A bitterer attack yet, <i>An Epistle to Julian</i>
(c.&nbsp;1686-7), paints her as ill, feeble, dying:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
Doth that lewd Harlot, that Poetick Quean,<br>
Fam’d through <i>White Fryars</i>, you know who I mean,<br>
Mend for reproof, others set up in spight,<br>
To flux, take glisters, vomits, purge and write.<br>
Long with a Sciatica she’s beside lame,<br>
Her limbs distortur’d, Nerves shrunk up with pain,<br>
And therefore I’ll all sharp reflections shun,<br>
Poverty, Poetry, Pox, are plagues enough for one.</p>

<p>In truth, Aphra Behn’s life was not one of mere pleasure, but a hard
struggle against overwhelming adversity, a&nbsp;continual round of work.
We cannot but admire the courage of this lonely woman, who, poor and
friendless, was the first in England to turn to the pen for a
livelihood, and not only won herself bread but no mean position in the
world of her day and English literature of all time. For years her name
to a new book, a&nbsp;comedy, a&nbsp;poem, an essay from the French, was
a word to conjure with for the booksellers. There are anecdotes in
plenty. Some true, some not so reliable. She is said to have introduced
milk-punch into England.<a class = "tag" name = "tag56" id = "tag56"
href = "#note56">56</a> We are told that she could write
<span class = "pagenum">lviii</span>
a page of a novel or a scene of a play in a room full of people and yet
hold her own in talk the while.<a class = "tag" name = "tag57" id =
"tag57" href = "#note57">57</a> Her popularity was enormous, and edition
after edition of her plays and novels was called for.</p>

<p>In 1690, there was brought out on the stage a posthumous comedy,
<i>The Widow Ranter</i>.<a class = "tag" name = "tag58" id = "tag58"
href = "#note58">58</a> But without her supervision, it was badly cast,
the script was mauled, and it failed. In 1696 Charles Gildon, who posed
as her favourite protégé (and edited her writings), gave <i>The Younger
Brother</i>. He had, however, himself tampered with the text. The actors
did it scant justice and it could not win a permanent place in the
theatrical repertory. In May, 1738, <i>The Gentleman’s Magazine</i>
published <i>The Apotheosis of Milton</i>, a&nbsp;paper, full of
interest, which ran through several numbers. It is a Vision, in which
the writer, having fallen asleep in Westminster Abbey, is conducted by a
Genius into a spacious hall, ‘sacred to the Spirits of the Bards, whose
Remains are buried, or whose Monuments are erected within this Pile. To
night an Assembly of the greatest Importance is held upon the Admission
of the Great Milton into this Society.’ The Poets accordingly appear
either in the habits which they were wont to wear on earth, or in some
suitable attire. We have Chaucer, Drayton, Beaumont, Ben Jonson,
<span class = "pagenum">lix</span>
and others who are well particularized, but when we get to the laureates
and critics of a later period there are some really valuable touches. In
1738 there must have been many alive who could well remember Dryden,
Shadwell, Otway, Prior, Philips, Sheffield Duke of Buckinghamshire,
Dennis, Atterbury, Lee, Congreve, Rowe, Addison, Betterton, Gay. In the
course of his remarks the guide exclaims to the visitor: ‘Observe that
Lady dressed in the loose <i>Robe de Chambre</i> with her Neck and
Breasts bare; how much Fire in her Eye! what a passionate Expression in
her Motions; And how much Assurance in her Features! Observe what an
Indignant Look she bestows on the President [Chaucer], who is telling
her, <i>that none of her Sex has any Right to a Seat there</i>. How she
throws her Eyes about, to see if she can find out any one of the
Assembly who inclines to take her Part. No! not one stirs; they who are
enclined in her favour are overawed, and the rest shake their Heads; and
now she flings out of the Assembly. That extraordinary Woman is <i>Afra
Behn</i>.’ The passage is not impertinent, even though but as showing
how early condemnatory tradition had begun to incrustate around Astrea.
Fielding, however, makes his Man of the World tell a friend that the
best way for a man to improve his intellect and commend himself to the
ladies is by a course of Mrs. Behn’s novels. With the oncoming of the
ponderous and starched decorum of the third George’s reign her vogue
waned apace, but she was still read and quoted. On 12 December, 1786,
Horace Walpole writes to the Countess of Upper Ossory, ‘I&nbsp;am
<span class = "pagenum">lx</span>
going to Mrs. Cowley’s new play,<a class = "tag" name = "tag59" id =
"tag59" href = "#note59">59</a> which I suppose is as <i>instructive</i>
as the <i>Marriage of Figaro</i>, for I am told it approaches to those
of Mrs. Behn in Spartan delicacy; but I shall see Miss Farren, who, in
my poor opinion is the first of all actresses.’ Sir Walter Scott admired
and praised her warmly. But the pinchbeck sobriety of later times was
unable to tolerate her freedom. She was condemned in no small still
voice as immoral, loose, scandalous; and writer after writer, leaving
her unread, reiterated the charge till it passed into a byword of
criticism, and her works were practically taboo in literature,
a&nbsp;type and summary of all that was worst and foulest in Restoration
days. The absurdities and falsity or this extreme are of course patent
now, and it was inevitable the recoil should come.</p>

<p>It is a commonplace to say that her novels are a landmark in the
history of fiction. Even Macaulay allowed that the best of Defoe was ‘in
no respect... beyond the reach of Afra Behn’. Above all <i>Oroonoko</i>
can be traced directly and indirectly, perhaps unconsciously, in many a
descendant. Without assigning her any direct influence on Wilberforce,
much of the feeling of this novel is the same as inspired Harriet
Beecher Stowe. She has been claimed to be the literary ancestress of
Bernardin de Saint-Pierre and Chateaubriand; nor is it any exaggeration
to find Byron and Rousseau in her train. Her lyrics, it has been well
said, are often
<span class = "pagenum">lxi</span>
of ‘quite bewildering beauty’, but her comedies represent her best work
and she is worthy to be ranked with the greatest dramatists of her day,
with Vanbrugh and Etheredge; not so strong as Wycherley, less polished
than Congreve. Such faults as she has are obviously owing to the haste
with which circumstances compelled her to write her scenes. That she
should ever recover her pristine reputation is of course, owing to the
passing of time with its change of manners, fashions, thought and style,
impossible. But there is happily every indication that &mdash;long
neglected and traduced&mdash;she will speedily vindicate for herself, as
she is already beginning to do, her rightful claim to a high and
honourable place in our glorious literature.</p>

<h4><a name = "intro_text" id = "intro_text">The Text.</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> text of the dramatic work is
primarily based upon the edition of 1724, four volumes, by far the best
and most reliable edition of the collected theatre. Each play, however,
has been carefully collated with the original quartos, some of which are
of excessive rarity, and if, in the case of any divergence, the later
reading is preferred, reason why is given in the Textual Notes upon that
specific passage. To the Dramatis Personae are in each case added those
characters which hitherto were negligently omitted: I&nbsp;have,
further, consistently numbered the scenes and supplied (where necessary)
the locales. In the order of the plays the 1724 edition has been
followed as preserving the traditional and accepted arrangement. The
only change herein made is the transferring of <i>The Emperor of the
Moon</i> from Vol. IV to Vol. Ill, and the placing of <i>The Amorous
Prince</i> before <i>The Widow Ranter</i>, so that the two posthumous
plays may thus be found in their due order together at the end of
Vol.&nbsp;IV.</p>

<p>With regard to metrical division, I&nbsp;have (unless a special note
on any one particular line draws attention to the contrary) in this
difficult matter followed the first quartos, as at this point 1724
proves not so satisfactory, and prints much as prose which the earlier
separate editions give as verse. A&nbsp;notable instance may be found in
<i>The Amorous Prince</i>. To the above rule I adhere so strictly as
even not to divide into lines several scenes in <i>The Widow Ranter</i>
and <i>The Younger Brother</i> which are palpably blank verse, but yet
which are not so set in the quartos of 1690 and 1696. I&nbsp;felt that
the metrical difficulties and kindred questions involved were so capable
of almost infinite variations, that to attempt a new and decisive text
in this matter would not merely be hazardous but also unproductive of
any real benefit or ultimately permanent result.</p>

<p>The valuable Dedications and Prefaces, never before given in the
collected editions, are here reprinted for the first time from the
originals. With regard to the novels the first separate edition has in
every case been collated. When impossible, however, so to do (as&nbsp;in
the exception of <i>Oroonoko</i>), the earliest accessible text has been
taken, and if any difficulty arose, all editions of any value whatsoever
were likewise consulted. For <i>La Montre</i> (<i>The Lover’s
Watch</i>), the original edition of 1686 was used. Any difference in
text which has been adopted from later editions is duly noted in the
textual apparatus to that piece. The Poems have in every case been
printed from the first&mdash;which are generally the
only&mdash;editions. Where they appeared as broadsides, these, when
traceable, have been collated.</p>

The Portraits Of Mrs. Behn.</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">Of</span> Mrs. Behn there exist three
portraits, one by Mary Beale, a&nbsp;second by John Riley, and the third
by Sir Peter Lely.</p>

<p>The Beale portrait has been engraved: ‘Aphra Behn. From a Picture by
Mary Beale in the collection of His Grace the Duke of Buckingham. Drawn
by T.&nbsp;Uwins. Engraved by J.&nbsp;Fittler, A.R.A. London.
1&nbsp;March, 1822. Published by W.&nbsp;Walker, 8&nbsp;Grays Inn
Square.’ The original oil painting was purchased at the Stow Sale in
1848 (No.&nbsp;57 in the sale catalogue), by J.&nbsp;S. Caldwell,
a&nbsp;literary antiquarian, Linley Wood, Staffordshire. A&nbsp;letter
which I wrote to <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i> (26&nbsp;November,
1914) on the subject of these portraits brought me a most courteous
permission from Major-General F.&nbsp;C. Heath Caldwell, the present
owner of Linley Wood, to view the picture.</p>

<p>With regard to the well-known and most frequently reproduced portrait
by Riley, this, engraved by R.&nbsp;Wise, figures as frontispiece to
<i>The Unfortunate Bride</i> (title page, 1700, and second title page,
1698). It is also given before the <i>Novels</i> (1696, 1698, and other
editions). Engraved by B.&nbsp;Cole, the same portrait fronts the
<i>Plays</i>, 4&nbsp;vols., 1724, and the <i>Novels</i>, 2&nbsp;vols.,
1735. It again appears ‘H.&nbsp;R. Cook, Sculp.’, published
1&nbsp;August, 1813, by I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;H. Payne, when it was included
as an illustration to the <i>Lady’s Monthly Museum</i>.</p>

<p>The portrait by Sir Peter Lely, which is reproduced as frontispiece
to this edition of Mrs. Behn, was exhibited at the South Kensington
Portrait Exhibition of 1866 by Philip Howard, Esq., of Corby Castle, the
head of the Corby branch of the Howard family.</p>

<p>The portrait of Mrs. Behn which appears as frontispiece to the
<i>Plays</i>, 2&nbsp;vols., 1716, is none other than Christina of Sweden
from Sebastian Bourdon’s drawing now in the Louvre.</p>

<p>A so-called portrait of Mrs. Behn, ‘pub. Rob’t Wilkinson’, no date,
is of no value, being, at best, a&nbsp;bad pastiche from some very poor
engraving.</p>

Aphra now appears on Mrs. Behn’s gravestone, and is the accepted form.
This is, however, in all probability the third inscription. <i>The
Antiquities of Westminster</i> (1711), quoting the inscription, gives
Aphara. Sometime in the eighteenth century a certain Thomas Waine
restored the inscription and added to the two lines two more:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">

The world admires and the Muses praise.</p>

<p>The name was then Aphara. The <i>Biog. Brit.</i>, whilst insisting on
Aphara as correct and citing the stone as evidence, none the less prints
Apharra. Her works usually have Mrs. A.&nbsp;Behn. One Quarto misprints
‘Mrs. Anne Behn’. There are, of course, many variants of the name.
Afara, and Afra are common. Oldys in his MS. notes on Langbaine writes
Aphra or Aphora, whilst the <i>Muses Mercury</i>, September, 1707, has a
special note upon a poem by Mrs. Behn to say ‘this Poetess’ true Name
was Apharra.’ Even Aphaw (Behen, in the 1682 warrant,) and Fyhare

In ‘Mrs. Behn’s <i>Oroonoko</i>’ Dr. Bernbaum elaborately endeavours to
show that this story is pure fiction. His arguments, in many cases
advanced with no little subtlety and precision, do not appear
(to&nbsp;me at least) to be convincing. We have much to weigh in the
contrary balance: Mrs. Behn’s manifest first-hand knowledge of, and
extraordinary interest in, colonial life; her reiterated asseverations
that every experience detailed in this famous novel is substantially
true; the assent of all her contemporaries. It must further be
remembered that Aphra was writing in 1688, of a girlhood coloured by and
seen through the enchanted mists of a quarter of a century. That there
are slight discrepancies is patent; the exaggerations, however, are not
merely pardonable but perfectly natural. One of Dr. Bernbaum’s most
crushing arguments, when sifted, seems to resolve itself into the fact
that whilst writing <i>Oroonoko</i> Mrs. Behn evidently had George
Warren’s little book, <i>An Impartial Description of Surinam</i>
(London, 1667), at hand. Could anything be more reasonable than to
suppose she would be intimately acquainted with a volume descriptive of
her girlhood’s home? Again, Dr. Bernbaum bases another line of argument
on the assumption that Mrs. Behn’s father was a barber. Hence the
appointment of such a man to an official position in Surinam was
impossible, and, ‘if Mrs. Behn’s father was not sent to Surinam, the
only reason she gives for being there disappears’. We know from recent
investigation that John Amis did not follow a barber’s trade, but was
probably of good old stock. Accordingly, the conclusions drawn by Dr.
Bernbaum from this point cannot now be for a moment maintained.</p>

plot and producing striking situations, in which she has few equals.’ He
frequently insists upon her ‘great skill in conducting the intrigue of
her pieces’, and with no little acumen declares that ‘her comedies may
be cited as the most perfect models of the drama of the latter half of
the seventeenth century.’</p>

Mr. Gosse in the Dictionary of National Biography basing upon the

some time at the doors of the theatres with this tragi-comedy that could
find neither manager nor publisher, she put it away and wrote <i>The
Forc’d Marriage</i>, which proved more successful. Dr. Baker follows
this, but I confess I cannot see due grounds for any such
hypothesis.</p>

In view of the extremely harsh treatment Ravenscroft has met with at the
hands of the critics it may be worth while emphasizing Genest’s opinion
that his ‘merit as a dramatic writer has been vastly underrated’.
Ravenscroft has a facility in writing, an ease of dialogue, a&nbsp;knack
of evoking laughter and picturing the ludicrous, above all a vitality
which many a greater name entirely lacks. As a writer of farce, and
farce very nearly akin to comedy, he is capital.</p>

<i>Letters from the Dead to the Living</i>: The Virgin’s [Mrs.
Bracegirdle] Answer to Mrs. Behn. ‘You upbraid me with a great discovery
you chanc’d to make by peeping into the breast of an old friend of mine;
if you give yourself but the trouble of examining an old poet’s
conscience, who went lately off the stage, and now takes up his lodgings
in your territories, and I don’t question but you’ll there find Mrs.
<i>Behn</i> writ as often in black characters, and stand as thick in
some places, as the names of the generation of <i>Adam</i> in the first
of <i>Genesis</i>.’ How far credence may be given to anything of Brown’s
is of course a moot point, but the above passage and much that follows
would be witless and dull unless there were some real suggestion of
scandal. Moreover, it cannot here be applied to Hoyle, whereas it very
well fits Ravenscroft. This letter which speaks of ‘the lash of Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash;r’ must have been written no great time after the
publication of Jeremy Collier’s <i>A Short View of the Immorality of the
English Stage</i> (March, 1698), probably in 1701-2. Ravenscroft’s last
play, <i>The Italian Husband</i>, was produced at Lincoln’s Inn Fields
in 1697, and he is supposed to have died a year or two later, which date
exactly suits the detail given by Brown. Ravenscroft’s first play,
<i>Mamamouchi</i>, had been produced in 1672, and the ‘an old poet’
would be understood.</p>

indictment for misconduct was actually presented against him at the Old
Bailey, but the Grand Jury threw out the bill and he was discharged. The
person implicated in the charge against Hoyle seems to have been a
poulterer, cf. <i>A Faithful Catalogue of our Most Eminent Ninnies</i>,
said to have been written by the Earl of Dorset in 1683, or (according

Betterton’s adaption of Marston’s <i>The Dutch Courtezan</i>, which the
actor calls <i>The Revenge; or, A&nbsp;Match in Newgate</i>, has
sometimes been erroneously ascribed to Mrs. Behn by careless writers.
She has also been given <i>The Woman Turn’d Bully</i>, a&nbsp;capital
comedy with some clever characterization, which was produced at Dorset
Garden in June, 1675, and printed without author’s name the same year.
Both Prologue and Epilogue, two pretty songs, <i>Oh, the little Delights
that a Lover takes</i>; and <i>Ah, how charming is the shade</i>,
together with a rollicking catch ‘O <i>London</i>, wicked
<i>London</i>-Town!’ which is ‘to be sung <i>a l’yvronge</i>, in a
drunken humour’, might all well be Mrs. Behn’s, and the whole conduct of
the play is very like her early manner. Beyond this, however, there is
no evidence to suggest it is from her pen.</p>

This fact sufficiently explodes the quite untenable suggestion that

Ravenscroft’s <i>Mamamouchi</i> was produced early in 1672, and

Neither of these was printed until eight years after her death. They

Third Edition, ‘with Large Additions,’ of <i>All the Histories and

<i>The Adventure of the Black Lady</i> follows a note: ‘These last three
never before published.’ Some superficial bibliographers (e.g. Miss

<p>With reference to <i>The King of Bantam</i> we have in the 1698
collected edition of the Novels the following ’<i>Advertisement to the

being so very different from Mrs. <i>Behn’s</i> usual way of Writing, it
may perhaps call its being genuine in Question; to obviate which
Objection, I&nbsp;must inform the Reader, that it was a Trial of Skill
upon a Wager, to shew that she was able to write in the Style of the
Celebrated <i>Scarron</i>, in Imitation of whom ’tis writ, tho’ the
Story be true. I&nbsp;need not say any thing of the other Two, they

Swift, although he amply fulfilled Dryden’s famous prophecy, ‘Cousin
Swift, you will never be a Pindaric poet’, was doubtless thinking of
these Pindarics when in <i>The Battle of the Books</i> he wrote: ‘Then

This piece finds a place in the unauthorised edition of Prior’s Poems,
1707, a&nbsp;volume the poet himself repudiated. In the Cambridge
edition of Prior’s <i>Works</i> (1905-7), reason is given, however, to
show that the lines are certainly Prior’s, and that he withdrew this and
other satires (says Curll, the bookseller), owing to ‘his great
Modesty’. The Horatian tag (Epistles i,&nbsp;xiv, 19) is of course
‘O&nbsp;Imitatores servum pecus’.</p>

Translations, with some little Latitude or variation from the Author’s
Sence: That of <i>Oenone</i> to <i>Paris</i>, is in Mr. Cowley’s way of
Imitation only. I&nbsp;was desir’d to say that the Author who is of the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
